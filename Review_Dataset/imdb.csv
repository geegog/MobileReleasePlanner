N,Janete.
N,Thank you :-)
P,Great.
N,Perfect for geting some quick information on movies and TV.
R,Still lacking many elements of a full website experience but still a great app.
N,8.8/10
N,IMDB.
P,Love it.
N,Db.
N,It has what we need.
N,Movie details and allows us to manage our list of movies
R,Good but could be better.
R,you could ad more list of movies thn it will be easy for us to find.
N,Mesage boards.
N,I go to show next 20 and view a thread.
N,I then come out and I am back at the beginning.
N,It is not good when you've pressed show next 20 a few times.
N,It's like groundhog day
E,Great information!
P,Love this Ap.
E,Some of the biographies are short.
N,I get lots of entertainment and information from this app.
E,Too many ads to be usable.
E,With every update Amazon makes the content less accessible and the ads more intrusive.
E,This app is becoming painful to use.
E,"Sadly,  it's still better than the Web site."
P,i love movies i love imdb!
E,new update's just perfect
P,Best movie app ever !
P,Great app .
E,contains all useful information for every movie :)
P,Great.
N,Why does it keep forgeting who I am?
N,Bloody iritating.
N,It is not working on 4.4.
N,Bu
P,Amazing.
P,this is amazing I can watch any trailer for free
E,Lacks way too much functionality you'd find present on the website.
E,Most notably the user reviews section.
N,"Where's the dropdown filter (loved, hated, etc.)?"
N,Where's the pagination?
R,"From an episode page, there's no link to take you back to the series or even a mention of what series it belongs to whatsoever."
N,That's just the tip of the iceberg.
N,Bre bre.
N,It suck you have to pay for everything not one is free
N,So much info in one place.
P,Awesome
P,Best.
P,Best app to search for movie info
P,Love it.
P,All good.
N,Movies.
R,I mean that I want movie not TRAILER because in youtube I can't even watch without wifi!
N,You wrong
E,Message Boards are still not fixed!
B,"When you click on ""next 20 messages"", it automatically opens the first thread in the next 20 and never gives the option to view any other threads."
B,When you close that thread you are back to the first page of message threads.
B,Please fix and I will give 5 stars.
P,Loved this app before the last 3 updates.
N,I have a Samsung S4.
E,It is very useful.
P,Great app for a world that loves cinema!
B,Search stoped working.
B,After I type something in the search box and press enter on keyboard nothing hapens.
E,"Otherwise, its a good app but most important function is broken."
N,IMDb Movie and TV.
N,Don't use
N,Xperia M2.
P,I'm lovin it
P,Lovee.
N,It does help me to discover movies that I want to watch
N,A. It's a vacation ap
N,S.
P,So good
P,hate it.
N,i want to watch a movie but its all just the trailer
N,Blood line
N,S3.
P,Best app for finding celebrities and movies
N,Free app but not free to watch.
E,It's useless.
E,USELESSSSS!
P,"I use this app probably 4 times a day, I love it."
R,My theaters missing.
P,This was once a great app.
N,Quick way to find movies at the local theaters.
E,"Now, the closest theater is 50+ miles away?"
N,Why is this?
N,Politics or incompetent programers?
N,"6 months later, local theaters still don't show."
N,Why?
N,WME theaters not acceptable to your company?
N,It does what it says.
N,Always use this app as a reference for movies or shows that I want to watch.
N,Release dates.
N,Age of Ultron on 4/22?
N,Try May 1.
N,Otherwise all seem to be Wednesday instead of Friday.
N,It is not the Ap's fault.
N,Update:  aparently it's the first international release date listed.
N,Don't get me started (I'm American).
P,good ap
P,Loved it.
N,First I see then comment baby
N,Can't be deleted!
P,"I think this is a good app if you're interested in geting info on movies, music, TV,  etc."
E,"But,  I am not interested in this genre and I should have the option of fully deleting this app from my phone."
E,This app is taking up space that I  could use for some other app that really is interesting to me.
P,My most used app ever!
N,"Literally I use IMDB over any ap, a MUST for movie lovers"
N,Material design.
R,material design UI should be aplied
N,Sema app.
E,It's very usefull
P,Good but it can be bater
N,Hello!
N,How about a fwd  buton?
E,Txt still too  small.
P,Cool app.
P,Cool
E,Made Less Useful.
N,When the app shows you what is playing nearby this should not include theaters 100 miles away.
N,Ap used to allow you to set a maximum distance.
E,This is annoying.
P,Love it
N,Retarded.
N,It says you can download it for free but you still have to pay to watch the movie you want to.
N,And it says download for free and watch for free.
N,Can't find any info anymore thru all the bling and advertising.
N,Usually just google now.
N,HTC desire 510
E,It is not available for india.
B,"Though it's a very nice app but i can't ad my location, it is curently unavailable for india."
N,Please do something.
N,It's a must have app.
P,Great.
N,I liked it because most of the movies I went is because of its ratings in the IMDb
E,Website is Beter.
N,Fed up of having to refer to the website because this app doesn't list some of the films on TV.
E,The website is much better or i just Google it
N,Nice.
N,All information aps should be like this.
P,GREAT APP FOR LOGITECH REVUE.
E,I use this app all the time for a variety of reasons but the one feature that I find indispensible and not readily available elsewhere is the parants rating section.
E,There is usually information on the specific language or actions that warant a PG13 or R rating.
N,I never let my kids see any movie rated higher than G unless I consult IMDB!
N,IMDB.
P,Perfect app for movie lovers like myself
P,Grat app.
N,Your one-stop shop for everything movies and tv.
E,"All info neatly accessible, great ap,used to use it all the time for both trailers as well as looking up information."
N,"The only downside is that in order for us to watch a trailer, which is basically an advertisement for a movie, one is first presented with an advertisement."
N,So now I only use it to search for information about movies or series instead.
N,One stop app for things Film and TV.
N,"I have loved this site ever since I first discovered it many years ago, but with the app (which is a must install on all new devices) the experience has just got so much better."
E,"The depth of the info is satisfying, the clips and videos give good previews."
E,When playing google movies the interaction with the characters on screen and the seamless connection to imdb is invaluable.
N,Thanks people don't stop what you're doing its all good.
N,Give the man an Oscar!
N,I really love this app cause I can rate a movie after go to the cinema :D
N,I can dig it
P,Like it

N,"Great ap, but now it won't let me view all the new DVD/Blu ray releases."
B,Please fix.
R,still missing useful info.
R,what about improving announced release dates for DVD and BR for region1?
N,any hope of imdb partnerships with UltraViolet and DisneyMoviesAnywhere?
N,allow me to select external video player (vlc) for all streams - stop trying to roll your own.
N,Nicee aplication

P,I love the app.
N,Watch list.
R,"I like the app but I really would love if I can make watch list on my own, like what I want to watch and what I already did watch what I may and may not watch list !"
N,If that hapen you would earn the 5 stars
P,I extremely love it.
P,I honour this is so good
N,A Must Download For Sure!
N,This is my go-to app for almost all of my entertainment industry inquiries.
E,"From a personal prospective, this app has 100% reliable information and is super easy to navigate through."
P,Superb job IMDb Android Team
N,It's ok for identifying most films and actors.
E,"The trailers don't always run smoothly, and devour a TON of data, regardless of seting."
E,The onscreen message you get from IMDB when pages won't load is childish and stupid.
E,"Also, re: the message boards, if you dare to share a thought about a film on you will be agravated contradicted and insulted."
N,But as a database IMDb is OK.
N,What?
N,Can we watch MOVIES
E,Super SLOW!
N,It takes so long to play trailers on imdb.
E,It buffers a lot.
N,Fine.
N,Runs fine on a Nexus 5.
P,Good.
P,Vary good
R,Material design please!
N,I'll give 5 stars when you match the material design guidelines.
N,Mob wifes

E,I love this app its functional.
P,Good app for movie info
P,Awesome.
P,1 of the best aps ever
N,Crap:.
E,It is better to simply google it and then use the IMDb website.
E,"The search engine on this app is useless, it is totally incapable of finding anything."
P,Great ap
P,Love this!
N,"Simply a great ap, must have for movie geeks!"
R,great app but needs chromecast suport.
E,this app has come a long way and it's a useful app for a website I go to frequently.
R,"I wish that they would ad chromecast suport for the trailers, and the layout could use a few tweaks, but it's a great app otherwise."
N,I access this app at least once or twice a day!
N,"A must have for those, ""I know them, what else have they been in"" times."
P,It's basically perfect
P,Good job!
E,Geting better and better!
N,What's going on.
R,"After your last update and your new update I still can't search for any films in the search bar if I can't search for films this app will be useless to me and this is the best app ever un till fixed 5 stars to 1,UPDATE.back to good old imdb but now with a bit more oomph,ty now enjoy your 5 stars back don't lose them again please"
P,"Great app for a movie loving community, but."
N,I really love IMDb a lot and have been a registered user ever since I discovered the site.
E,The app is certainly a useful guide to the info I need and like.
E,"However, some bits of info are somewhat far off, or hard to find, like user reviews."
R,I would love to be able just to tap on the rating and go to the user's reviews.
N,"All in all a great ap, for a great community."
N,Keep going!
E,Totally invaluable!
N,Right on
E,Good companion for movie lovers.
N,Information in the palm of my hands
P,"Great ap, but."

N,THE RATINGS and THE BOARDS.
N,I love a lot of the features of the app and have come to open it on an almost daily basis.
N,"That said, the star ratings ARE STILL NOT STICKING!"
N,"When I rate something and then go do something else but hapen to go look at my rating later, it's like I NEVER EVEN rated it; it's back to 0 stars!"
R,"Also the forum needs fixing when reading past the 1st topicture page; you can't read a topicture and go back to where you were, it always goes back to the beginning of the boards."

R,Being able to set which fact links would be awesome.
E,Oh and photos at the top is annoying!
R,Again all these design changes should be OPTIONAL!

E,"I like that one can ad trivia, but user reviews seems more sensical."

N,5 stars!

N,Also really  does not look as good as on the iPhone
N,tez.
P,I love this ap
N,### Movies on your watchlist aren't automatically removed after rating (why not let users choose their prefered watchlist behavior?)
R,"### Ratings overview tab could be a litle less clutered (too many stats below each title) ### A separate seting for the language would be great (I'm german, so I had to set my whole phone to English to get english titles instead of german ones) ### You can't ad movies to lists other than your watchlist."
P,+++ But all in all it's a great app.
N,Fandango link is a mess.
N,This once great app is selling out to other revenue sources and diluting the beauty and simplicity of the app.
N,When the app takes you to Fandango there is no turning back.
B,You can't press the back buton to return to IMDB.
R,Fandango needs to create a 'return to IMDB' buton.
N,For movie adicts
E,It's terific and.
N,I've loyally frequented IMDb with regularity for many years.
N,"But, as with most websites, I'm not sure why I needed a special app when simply clicking my browser's bookmark and loging in serves the same purpose."
N,*shrug*
N,Broken Features and Wasted Screen Space.
E,The Watchlist is re-sorted to its default seting each time the app is launched.
E,It is very annoying.
N,"Also, a recent update aded series and episode photos to the top of the screen."
N,"Aside from the pointless waste of space, the photos can reveal spoilers for TV episodes you haven't yet watched."
R,I'd like to see an option aded so we can remove them.
P,excellent.
N,what would I do without IMDb?
N,It is not updating newly released on DVD.
N,Hasn't updated new releases to DVD and blueray for nearly 4 weeks.
N,I wonder.
N,if this is by amazon - no chromecast
E,Seems better.
B,Cannot play video after update.
N,On Samsung s4 and same with HTC M8
N,Avoid updating!
N,"Don't update the new version, advert comes before every trailer!"
N,Why did you spoil it IMDB?!
N,It's alright.

E,It's a fairly solid app but a lot of info still is only on the proper website.
N,So why bother?
N,IMBO TV serf.
N,Television cooperation media

R,"I have one request, if you guys could also show the budget of the movie on movie home page it will be awesome."
N,still can be made better
R,A)Please can you give us a watchlist which separates both TV shows and movies in 2 different category.
R,B) Please give the ad to watchlisht sign even when we are seeing lists of movies cos it's a litle hectic to press the movie title then wait and then trip on the ? sign
E,Slow at times.
R,Time for a material design update.
B,Keeps crashing.
E,"It's my favorite website/ap, but the android version runs slow and  keeps crashing."
N,I use Samsung Galaxy 4.
P,Good for info!
E,"In terms of info (films tv actors trivia etc) this app is unrivalled, however the star system and reviewing of movies is definitely not to be trusted!"
N,This is due to users rather than the app hence why i'm not marking it down!
P,Excellent Ap!
P,Great app.
N,"As a person who rates a lot of films, this app comes in handy."
B,It does freeze from time to time (what app doesn't).
P,Otherwise it's a great app.
N,"Haven't had any major issues on my previous phones with it, and am not anticipating any now."
N,WTF IMDB.

N,Get rid of the ads and I'll install your app and praise IMBD once again.

B,"However, I constantly get signed out."
E,It's incredibly annoying.
B,"Plus, for a while now the images next to the titles when I search never load (in the drop down)."
N,This is the same for actors and films.
N,Update: Still not fixed.
N,"Plus, going back to a list after selecting a film takes you all the way to the top."
N,I have a list of 100's of films.

N,Brilliant app for movies TV or any films good reviews I always check in before watching any film recommend to everyone
N,Watching.
B,I cannot watch movies fix it
E,Good app but forums need work.
P,I love the app.
N,I use it 3-4 times a day.
N,However I only rate 2 stars because the forums need a re-working.
N,When viewing the forums (my favorite part of IMDb) you see 20 topictures at a time.
N,If you expand the next 20 and then read a topicture once you go back you have to keep expanding.
N,If your 60 or 80 topictures down this is a nuisance.
E,Also the show 20 more topictures link is so close to the botom I always end up opening topicture 21 instead of expanding.
E,Rework the forums to be more user friendly on the app.
N,Tomas.
N,Puiki programa su detaliu film? apra??ymu.
N,shwetank.
N,nice ap

N,Period.
E,Faster and easier than visiting the website.
N,So freaking stupid!
R,This is so stupid I bought this app thinking you could watch the freaking movie but I guess I am wrong its just to see the show time and place!
N,I wanted to watch Fifty Shades Of Grey for the second time and didn't want to go to the theater but I might!
N,If you want people to use this app give it a name it's worthy to cause this is the oposite than it is!
N,The movie might not be up there because its still in theater but I would rather you not even have the trailer than trick people!
P,Good one.I sugest for movie lovers
N,Just installed it and It keeps saying sign in error and I've tried 4 or 5 times to log in.
N,What should I do to fix this?
N,Don't even now it.

N,It is alright if you ask me!
E,Look at  the best movies the picture clear.
P,Love  the app its the best
N,Update or downgrade ?.
N,"So firstly they updated the message board which made each thread impossible to read, now the 'updated' it to the previous way and it's difficult/impossible to read more than the first 20 threads."
P,Good job Imdb.
N,If I have a choice I'll switch aps.
E,Sugestions are welcome.

N,If you let 20 or 30 of your loyal users test this new update that mistake would never have hapened!
P,Movie lover!
P,Quick stats on my favorite movies and actors!
P,Super  cool
N,MESSAGE BOARDS FIXED.
E,The general looking up of movies and names works well enough.
E,The message boards work corectly again but when I go into a particular message and come back is forgets where I was and goes back to the top of the subject list.
B,Please fix!
N,Login broken.
N,I shouldn't have to keep signing in.
N,You are not a bank.
N,If i didn't want movie info I'd uninstall.
R,Someone should make a better movie site.
E,So glad the message boards are useable again!
R,No more scrolling back and forth!
N,Won't load casts in shows or load filmography for actors.
E,Prety annoying
E,Useful Aplication.
R,Would love a watched list.
N,"To compliment watchlist as I have a rubish memory, I think."
N,So hapy.
N,They have empire  on their
N,Forum issue.
N,It's still a great app I always turn too but whenever I'm in any forum now when I scroll down ans select to option for next 20 it just then takes me to whatever the next post is.
N,It won't stay with the next 20 just straight into someones post.
N,I'm on android dunno if the problem but it's frustrating as I can't view anything other than first 20 forum posts
N,Message board layout.
E,"The best part of this app was the message boards, but the last two updates messed up the layout and it is painful to read on a mobile due to having to continuously sidescroll line by line."
N,Don't get this fixed and you will lose users to an app with better forum layout.
R,"Update: in the latest update the message boards have been reverted back to the old version, which I prefer more than the ""updated"" one, however it brings back with it the problems with the old format."
N,Sigh.
N,Give it an aditional star
N,I thought this is free.
N,But yet you have to pay to watch it .
N,boo?????? ugh!
B,Bugs and now ads before trailer?!
B,Fix the bugs with the videos: they are laging!
E,And these ads before trailers are so annoying!
E,Loads slowly.
N,History doesn't have much.
P,Used to be so great and Quick!
E,Loads very chopy and slow on 4g and WiFi.
N,History section doesn't store like it used to.
N,I'd rather go to the website these days

B,It loads several minutes and still won't open.
B,Please fix this problem.
N,Om Raman.
N,Thanks for Google nice aps
R,It still needs a feature for the lists.
N,I can't access my lists.
P,Awsome.
N,It let me watch anything i want than any.other aps???????
N,Could be better.
E,Too many clicks to get what you want to see.
N,They've compartmentalized the website into more sections than needed.
E,"Search is bad, the slightest misspelling and you get nothing."
N,Won't load.
N,Bogus
P,The best.
E,"The best movie, show and actor/actress database out there."
E,It is not to mention the movie times feature and movie trailers.
P,Really love this app.

P,It is very good.
E,I love the movies and the birthday celebrate

P,awesome.
N,nice ap
N,I haven't looked at it yet but if it's a sucky app I am only giving one star
E,Great film information locator.
N,If you need to know a film rating and what makes it that rating check out this app.
N,Non-User.
R,Sory I couldn't be more help!
N,Amazon fire.
B,IMDB continually crashes right after opening on the amazon fire.
N,Aby sugestions?
N,It is not so good for looking up what's in theatres.
N,When I look up what is playing in my area it doesn't show all the theaters for some reason.
N,So it's not entirely dependable for looking up movie times which is part of the reason I got the app in the first place.
P,I like it
P,Best.
P,Best app for checking movies reviews
P,Good ap
P,Great88888!
N,Ap
P,Loved it.
N,Try it

P,Good for movies
P,Great app.
N,Couldn't take it off my phone except when you don't use it a lot.
P,hate it.
N,its poty
N,Idc.
N,I am bored
B,Message boards fixed BUT.
N,"Hapy the the message boards were fixed but just try hiting ""Next 20"" and see what hapens!"
N,"I use a tool and not my finger and I've done it many many times and I'm positive that I'm hiting the ""next 20"" and not the post above it."
N,Yet that is what opens!
N,I can't get to the next 20 posts.
N,India not Suported :/.
R,The largest democracy with its bigest film industry is not suported by IMDB is that a joke !
R,No show timing region suport nothing only movie description.
R,bring India region suport for show timing and you will ad 50 million more users to your ap
N,Message board.
E,Since the latest update the message boards won't load at all on my Samsung galaxy s4.
B,"It worked perfectly before the last two updates, why change something that doesn't need fixing in the first place?"
P,Love it.
P,I love imdb.
N,Win so many bets and arguments with it.
P,I like it.
N,Great to have at my fingertips
N,I haven't use it yet but I gues it would be good after rewing the views of other.
N,It's fine with me
P,This Ap Needs 2 Things Aded To Be Great.
R,2 things need to be aded for this app to be great.
R,This app needs Material Design it would be very visually apealing to the eye for IMDb to have a Material Design element to it.
R,"This app needs a 1080p option for trailers, because there's a lot of phones that have been released recently that have a resolution of 1080p or higher."
R,Yes it would use a fair amount of data but make it an option to use only over WiFi.
N,Can't remove.
R,Just more bloatware for those of us who did not want a TV in our hands.
N,The message boards!
N,They're fixed!
N,Thank you!
P,Fantastic app for apk.
P,It is very good
N,Moto g 2nd generation.
E,Video's took lot of time to play even in wifi connection
P,Love it.
P,Love it
P,Great app.
E,Message board awful.
R,It's a brilliant app for all your movie needs but you've returned to the terible 'ap friendly' message board.
N,"It never remembers where you are (always throwing you back to the top 20), the butons are tiny and threads aren't even ordered the same as the main site (meaning new threads can be three or four pages down but old threads can be in the first 20)."
E,I'm baffled why users would prefer the terible functionality of this message board format
N,IMDB.
P,the best!
E,It is very ugly
P,Good.
E,Nice app for watch movie and release
B,Still doesn't work every time I click show next 20 it opens the next thread
P,Love thus ap!
N,I'm always on here either chating on the message boards and seeing what movies and shows that are coming out!
N,Message boards.
N,Fixed!
N,Loading problem.
N,"Load take an hour just to view an article, wtf !"
P,Excellent Ap.
E,The forum is better but still broken.
N,"If I click ""next 20"" it automatically opens the first of the second page and there is nothing I can do."
N,It's fine
P,Great ap!
E,The information is endless!
E,So easy to use.love it!
N,The wors.
N,This app doesn't even whatch a movie
E,The search bar always stops working.
N,"I've gone through this 15 times already, even when I disabled the app and enabled it again it didn't do shit.The search bar only worked after restarting the android device and even then stoped working after a few minutes."
B,Please fix this
R,Spoilers and Movie Connections missing!
E,Spoiler tags for the parents guide and spoiler warnings for the user reviews as non-existent for the Android version!
R,It would also be nice to have the movie connections available.
B,"Nice fix on the boards but now it is very annoying that when I try to get to the next 20 threads, IMDB app takes me to the last thread on the initial page, Fix this please!"
E,Useful and interesting.
N,I always use when watching a film or TV show to see who and what the actorsactresses have been in.
N,Message Board.
P,Unbelievable.
N,IMDb finally fixes their message board and then returns to the original Android version.
N,"There was some issues with the Web version, but at least I could track my post, ignore abusive trolls and newest post were at top of screen."
E,This version is so basic I'm shocked people prefer it.
P,Awful.
N,I'm using Samsung Galaxy S5.
N,So nice.
P,Good.
N,Nice app.
E,So useful
N,Amazing Ap; especially since they they brought back the old style message board.
N,Bloatware.
N,"OK ap, but I don't want it and can't remove it."
N,It's fixed.
N,Now I can read the message boards again without going baty.
N,Thank you!
E,I have used IMDb to look up music I have heard on TV program's and I have found it to be very useful.
E,Zero functionality.
B,Crashes after 45 seconds of opening and refuses to play videos on any network.
P,Shitiest app EVER
N,My go to app.
N,For finding everything I need to know about movies before I watch them.
P,Love it!
P,Liked it.
P,Liked it
E,"Ap good, forums part still sucks."
E,"Well, at least forums can be read again, but still a bit useless."
N,"Why does it not remember the ""page"" you were on and always scrolls back to the first twenty threads after you go back from reading an entry?"
N,Do you guys not do any usability testing?
E,Fricking small butons as well; half the time I end up opening the last thread.
N,"IMBD  Movies, TV, Ratings, Watch list, +."
N,Just the Basics + Cable Box is what $60.00.
N,"This IMBD~ $0.00,  It seems to have some of all the similar aps and  things."
P,I GOTTA LOVE IT ALREADY.
N,I'LL CHECK IT OUT SOME MORE AND TRY TO GET BACK TO           Ya'.
E,The app turns to be a bit slow in the recent couple updates.
N,WTF!
N,How do you watch movies on this?
N,I can only watch the trailers
E,Much better now that the message boards have been fixed.
N,Message boards.
E,Message boards are finally fixed!
E,Great app but seems slow and slugish since last update.
N,Samsung Galaxy S.
N,Still my number 1 for movie info.
N,Don't know any other app that can replace IMDB.
P,Simply amazing.
N,Thanks for fixing the message boards
P,Love it!
N,I can't believe how much info this app has on every single actor who had ever acted in history!
N,1MDB movies.
N,films
P,I love it
R,Something Missing.
R,"If I could view and edit my personal lists, as I can on iOS, then this'd be a 5* rating."
N,Glad to see it went back to old message board what was on it was very iritating
E,Player loads videos too slow.
E,In app player is so bad that i go to YouTube to watch trailer and then come back
N,Can't do without it.
E,"It's better on a laptop than a phone,  but still an excellent app."
E,The aplication is great but i hope that you ad the ability to access the lists through the ap
N,G8 for quick info
P,Message board issue fixed I love it
N,Message board fixed.
N,"Finally message board issue is fixed now, thanks!"
E,"But screen orientation still bugy, it turns to landscape automatically then goes back portrait during the video."
N,It used to work perfectly on prev versions.

N,Thank you for now puting in video are before watching a trailer now.
P,REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
N,I'm disapointed.

N,Now you've aded ads.
N,Making load time 10 minutes just to watch a 2 minute trailer at most.
N,3/5 because.
E,Users are still unable to view and edit lists.
N,When this function becomes available I'll give it 5 stars.
N,Use it a lot to find out all about movies and tv programes
N,Ap to SDcard.

B,:( Please fix!
N,Message Boards Fixed - Thank You.
N,Thanks for fixing the message boards.
N,Now if you can just get the message board section to remember how many pages into a forum you are after opening a message.
N,"When coming out of a message, the app returns you to the top of the message list."
R,"Then you need to scroll to the botom of each page and select ""next 20 messages"" x number of times to return to your last location you were at."
P,But I do love this app.
R,No widget!
R,There has to be a widget!

N,Then it would be almost perfect
N,Message boards.
N,Are fixed.
N,Thanks!
N,Why only up to 720p?
R,All these updates and yet no suport to playback trailers/videos in nothing more than 720p.
E,"With devices sporting 1080p and higher resolution displays now days, and higher speeds of connectivity, why not allow at least 1080p playback?"
R,That would be quite a bit better to watch on my LG G3's 2k display than 720p.
N,I would give 5* if that were possible.
E,Stupid message board.
N,What!
N,The aps Dev actually fixed something this time instead of breaking more things.
N,"Just fix it so the message board won't go back to the first page everytime you back out of a thread, and it'll be perfect."
B,What hapened to the message forum please fix was in the midle of good discussion.
E,Frequent flier.
E,"Use it a lot, though the search function isn't as useful as the website."
E,Searching by artist in a film with another artist etc being missing.
N,Mint.
P,"This app is a must have for any ,  Movie and TV lover."
R,Great and needs some more update.
E,It works prety fine and has a great user interface.
R,"But it would be better if we could see the rank of the Top 250 movies on their pages, and it would be even better if we could ad movies to the lists we want and see those lists."
R,needs Material Design and to be able to ad to lists other than just the watch list
P,The best .
E,Far better than any other app .
P,Still love it.
N,But.
R,"Too many updates, too frequently, don't see the need, should consolidate."
N,Lots of time wasted.
P,Good.
E,Good app but uk tv series and movies are not up to date.

N,Message boards.
N,Still don't like the fact that once you've pressed to load next 20 threads  if you view one then press back you have to open next 20 threads again to get back to where you were.
N,Can be a pain if you've pressed through a few times then get pushed right back to the top again.

R,The app would be a lot better and useful if you ad the option to view and edit your lists from the app.
R,This is a major drawback since even the mobile site does not have this option and the regular site doesn't load up that well in mobile devices.
R,"If lists are enabled, I would give it 5 stars."
P,Loved it
E,It is very useful
N,Must Have.
P,Great app for all movies fans !

P,Love ir.
P,Love this app.
E,It gives great information on celebs
N,Ad lists.
R,Would be nice if they would make it so I can access and use my lists like I can on their website.
N,Waste.
N,If i want to watch a movie.
N,I would rather use my TV or computer not sit here staring at a phone
N,For now.
E,Forums don't fit in the phone screen in either direction.
E,It's too annoying to try to read anything.
N,Would say 5 stars if this was fixed.
N,Ads.
E,The ads at the botom of the screen are even biger.
N,And take a few seconds to load so I accidentally click on the ads.
E,"Also when going to the message boards, the format makes them impossible to read"
N,Ugh.
E,The message board layout is extremely horible!

P,Excellent ap
E,Solid.
E,Solid and works well
N,Over a week and still no message board fix!
N,Did coders get the mobile version and the app mixed up?
E,Mobile message boards now look like the app boards used to.
R,"Bring them back to the ap, please."
E,the old forums are back!
N,IMDb.
N,I am always looking at this site
N,Basic.
R,"Can not browse categories, only top tv shows ."
N,sucks if you looking for something to watch
N,Message boards.
E,I like reading the message boards to see what people are saying about the movies or TV shows.
N,This app makes that impossible because it no longer formats for mobile.
B,It needs fixing.
E,"The Message Boards are worse than using a web browser, constant scrolling needed on a Galaxy S3."
N,It worked perfectly before the update.
R,Would be five stars if the above issue is fixed.
B,Fix the Message Forums.
E,It was a great app but the changes to message forums have made them completely useless.
N,Whoever signed off on the user testing for that section should be fired.
R,No user review.
R,Writing user reviews is not suported
R,can't write reviews in ap?
R,Can't give ratings without opening each movie's page.
N,why?
E,Sort option is missing from many pages.

E,Amazon ads in the botom sucks even more.
R,Couldn't ad movie to watchlist
P,Great Film Facts.
N,I can always count on this site to have the.
N,Answers to my questions along with all the facts and litle known details.
P,The Best!
P,Bad!
N,"IT ONLY BRINGS YOU TO TRAILERS, NOT REAL MOVIES."
N,"If you want to watch new movies, it only lets you buy tickets, while if you watch old movies, you have to pay a few US dollars"
N,No text wrap or zooming on message board since update
B,Fix the message boards!
N,Instead of improving the mobile message boards you guys made it even worse.
P,Good job.
N,Ugh.
E,The forums were a painful experience before the update (having to re-scroll down the page and hit next page each time you leave a post).
E,But now they're even worse!
N,Jj.
N,Nice one
E,Good integration
E,Too many ads.
E,Lots of info but the are far too intrusive.
N,Broken Message Boards after multiple updates.
N,Recently stoped loading the message boards properly.
N,It now loads the desktop page instead of the mobile site.
N,Will reconsider my score once it is fixed.
E,New ads take up 1/4 of the screen and can't be dismissed.
E,It is very annoying.
P,Great Ap.Except.
E,"Within the last few days, the window ad at the botom of the screen has doubled in height."
N,It now takes up almost 20% of the screen.
E,"Please update ap, message board feature is TERRIBLE"
N,Suck it
N,Atack of the ads.
N,Every click means a new ad that covers 1/3 of my phone's screen.
P,This sucks worst app ever
B,Message boards broken.
B,Please fix!
P,The app is prety good.
E,Interface could use some work.
E,"Those ads are extremely obnoxious, though."
N,Broke it.
N,"Thanks for breaking the ap, it worked fine until the update."
N,I'm just going to stop using imdb.
N,Ads and message boards.
E,Ads are way too intrusive now and the message boards will not resize text.
P,Great app.
E,Amazing detailed information of all sort of films.
E,"Since the latest update, it is very slow and the images take literally to the end if time to load."
N,"It's not my phone or my internet, because my phone used this app before the update flawlessly."
E,Now its barely usable.
N,Chromecast suport (for trailers) ?
E,Used to offer more information and be more user friendly.
R,Chromecast suport for trailers would be nice.
N,Still the go-to app for movie databases but disapointed by its evolution that is more a regression.
N,Poorly made app.
B,"After the new update, the commercials on the botom of the screen can't be closed so you can't access your account or setings anymore."
N,Way to go to advertise.
R,"Super great, but needs more info."
P,I absolutely love this app.
N,The team is ading more and more information that you'd normally need to visit the site for.
N,It's an app I've used religiously since it came to Android years ago.
N,Now can we get a paid version to get those stupid advertisements out of my click radius?
E,Ads are now twice as large and intrusive.
E,The forums area is broken.
E,The ads are way more invasive.
N,They really fixed it 'til it broke.
P,Love it
P,I like this aps.
P,I like this aps and love Nirme.
E,Forum messageboards unreadable on phone.
N,This app use to be 5 stars until they updated the messageboard to a web based look rather than the old mobile phone compatible look.
E,Now the messageboards are unreadable on a phone
P,"I love the ap, but."
E,I hate the new message board viewing.
N,It basically opens the webpage inside the app and you have to scroll back and forth to read everything.
E,Annoying!
N,Wow.
P,So good
B,Fix the message boards.
N,"The app itself is great, I use it all the time."
E,But the most recent update has made the message boards unbearable.
B,Please fix!
E,Message boards can't be viewed.
E,"Newest version wasn't coded corectly as message boards don't fit within mobile screens, making them largely unusable."
N,Get it together!
E,Message board views are awful.
N,"Hi,?? I just wanted to say that as someone who uses IMDB on an almost daily basis,?? I really like your app."
E,For the most part it is clean and pleasant to navigate.
E,Unfortunately the big issue though is with the way message boards are displayed.
N,This is where the app gets clunky and unpleasant.
E,It is difficult to read because the screen is too far zoomed in and users cannot see the whole page in either portrait or landscape mode.
R,Even more frustrating is that users cannot zoom out.
E,Strictly forum rating.
E,The forums on mobile are now terible.
N,"Before I had to scroll up and down, now it's up, down, left, right.I haven't put in those combinations since Contra on Nintendo."
N,Message boards?
R,Still need to fix the message boards to mobile view.
N,Forum section.
E,Forum section of the app was horible.
E,"Tedious to navigate, horibly slow and unresponsive."
E,Now it's totally unreadable.
B,Fix it please.
N,thnx.
P,imdb the best!

N,Used to enjoy reading the boards in bed but now it's just impossible.
N,Was hoping this update would fix this but no dice.
B,Please fix.
N,Broken.
E,"I used to love this ap, but now the forums are broken."
E,"Text scrolls way to far over so it makes it too annoying just to read the posts, let alone trying to reply to anything."
R,Text needs to wrap again or I'm gonna end up deleting.
N,"What's the point of a ap, when I have to get on my pc to use the forums?"
N,Joshua Clark.
N,Good luck
N,Lots of movie information.
N,"IMDb is great for remembering movie release dates, who played what role and what other movie they were in, and whatever other information you might need."
E,"The mobile website is sufficient, but the app came preloaded."
P,It is no good
N,Can you watch movies on this ap?
N,Someone doesn't know how to code.
N,It's not that hard to make the text fit on the screen.
E,"Even in landscape mode, the text expands farther than the screen and cannot shrink."
N,Totally ruined large parts of the app.
N,iOS doesn't have this issue.
N,Was a better team working on that one?
N,Fix the boards you morons.
N,"Used to be my go-to app for movies and TV shows, but the message board formating for mobile devices killed it."
N,"What are you doing, IMDB?"
N,Handing out stupidity to yourselves in spades?
N,Message boards.
N,Since the update the message boards have been changed.
E,The way the are design makes it harder to read and follow via the app on galaxy s5.
N,I have to rotate my screen which I hate just so I can read.
E,The old layout was better.
B,Please fix.
N,Boss.
P,great app love it
P,Great.
P,Just great
N,It does its job
R,Can't save showtimes.
R,"I use to be able to save showtimes to my calendar; can this option be put back, please?"
N,Nexus 7 tablet.
P,Love it!
P,A great help for a movie buff like me
B,Search function doesn't work
N,"More stars if I could login and see ""My Movies"" with my notes and ratings, AND if the trailers played!"
E,"4 * now for speed, content, easy GUI."
N,Droid2
R,No reviews option.
E,Feels a bit better but the message board is not working.
R,Still no option to review movies and it would be better if there is an option to mark movies as watched from my watchlist.
N,Update broke message boards
E,Message board broken.
N,Why why why have you changed the format?
N,It's now a mess.
P,Good app.
E,"It is easy to use and easy to find films, good descriptions and info about the films aswell"
N,Trash Ap.
N,More Bloatware that I am not interested in but am forced to have on my phone like the NFL app.
N,I should have the choice to delete them!
E,Message boards are jacked.
E,"Like many others, I came to ask the developers to fix the unusable message boards."
N,Once fixed then it's a 5 star app.
E,It is not all details of the actors and directors are true!
E,Update ruined the message boards.
P,Great.
N,Android version not as good as iPhone version.
P,Still a great app though.
N,It's just average
P,Love It.
P,I LOVE IT AWESOME
N,Love it but not the new update.
E,The new format for the message boards is so iritating that I don't even use it.
R,Please go back to the old format or update it so you font have to constantly slide the screen back and worth.
N,Nice I like this app.
E,It is very helpful.
N,Why?
E,"Since the recent change (I won't call it an update), the message boards are in web format."
N,Why?!
N,It's virtually impossible to read the comments easily now.
N,Uninstalling until I hear word this has been rectified as this app is simply taking up (vital) space.
N,"If it ain't broke, guys."
E,New Android Update SUCKS!
E,"I used to use this almost every day, but after the most recent Android update, the forums are impossible to read or navigate."
N,It's not fit-to-screen.
P,Hate it.
R,Hate it doesn't let me watch full movies :-[
R,Newest update won't let me download.
N,"Just got a new tablet and despite having over 500MB available, I am being told I don't have enough space for an app that is listed as being less than 6MB."
N,Will gladly improve the rating once I get a version that can actually be installed.
B,Can't log in.
B,Signed me out then does not let me sign in.
R,When are you ad lists?
N,"WTF, IMDb?"
N,How much time to go before list's functionality apear in ap?!
R,It does not let me watch movies.

R,I would like to be faster
P,Love it!
N,Update woes - third time's a charm.
B,Eror 961 until the third atempt.
E,Mobile webpage is much better.
N,Why bother with the app which is broken after latest updates when you can use the webpage.
E,so lagy
P,Perfect for movie lovers
B,Fix the forums please.
E,The last update has made the forum work in website mode.
N,"I updated hoping it would change with the curent update, but to no avail."
B,Fix the forums please.
E,New Update causes Problems.
N,Every preview I watch it's a surprise as to whether the video shows up portrait or landscape even with my screen rotation locked.
E,And the trailers also rotate every volume buton push.
E,Prety annoying.
N,Note 3.
E,Episode list for tv series not available in this ap
B,Updated  not working.
B,Geting  an error  can't  open
E,Latest update is terible!
E,The latest update is horible!
E,The page won't fit to the screen and now I have to click on each reply individually on the message board.
N,Help!
E,Update ruined the message boards.
N,"I use this app daily, and as part of the use I frequent the message boards."
E,"In previous versions of the app they weren't perfect (signatures were often indistinguishable from the text of the comment), but they worked."
E,"However, since a recent update the message boards have been messed up - now having the look of the web version of the site,  which means no wrap around text."
E,Scrolling left to right is a nightmare.
N,"If you want this app for message boards, then avoid downloading until fixed."
N,View by season?
N,View by season removed in new update.
N,How can I zero in on say Season 4 Episode 16 of a particular show?
P,Otherwise a great ap!
N,Message boards.
N,What with the new message board format?
B,Please fix.
N,It's not a good experience anymore.
N,It does What I'm Looking For.
P,Good site.
N,"Wouldn't mind if the bios had a litle more info, but I guess it IS a ""movie"" database, and not an ""actor"" database after all, so I won't mark you down to four stars."
N,It is not a fan of the new update.
N,It is impossible for me to read the message boards now.
B,Eror 961.
N,"Was my main source for movie information and was a 5, with latest update the 961Eror has caused it to not work."
N,Broke.
E,Today's update is borked and won't install.
N,Message boards.
