N,Yahoo weather.
N,Weather ap

N,Phew.
P,"Looks great, good info."
B,Edit: San Fran bug fixed.
E,I love the look of this app as well as the weather breakdown but as of a few updates back it's been a bit broken.

N,"However, horizontal scrolling in the forecast is chopy, no mater which device I use."
N,And they used to have a feature where rotating landscape would give you a full screen version of the flickr picture curently being presented.
N,Repeated inquiries about that have gone unanswered.

P,I'm  really pleased with this app.
E,The widget is nice.
E,It really is a beautiful looking app.
E,The only downside is that the radar doesn't play and there is no time stamp on it.
E,That portion is usless if it stays the same.
N,I understand that this is just WU with the Yahoo name on it and they have made it prety.
B,Please Yahoo get your devs to fix this.
N,Otherwise might just have to dump for WU

E,And the updates that post as notifications are perfect.
P,It's yahoo great!
