P,Good
N,Much potential.
R,"Needs more refinements- not able to highlight/comment in pdfs, clicking on footnote references seems you to back pages instead of a pop up."
R,Wish I could use one eReader instead of jumping to many different ones.

N,Literally!
E,It is helpful but.
N,The books taged free are not actually free why?
N,Google Books has come a long way.
N,"I started using the app again once I was able to use ts, upload my own books and sync with all my devices."
E,"Unfortunately, the uploader can be bugy and doesn't suport certain file types, but it's a good start."
E,Now my main concern is the library and sorting.
R,"There are no book shelves, no way to group books into categories, and no way to edit book titles and covers."
E,"The recents tab is good, but not enough if you have a lot of ebooks."
R,"Also, it should give a message if you're uploading a book that's already uploaded."
E,Poor performance.
B,Couldn't upload any PDF files despite repeated atempts.nd downloads are taking hours together and no 3d page turning.
B,app stops abruptly while reading

B,"When long clicked on a word, it shows the definition, but it is not allowed to be copied."
R,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Ad this feature because it will help me in my preparations of MBA.
N,"For every word I don't understand,  I copy it's definition and ad it as a note to the world."
N,I have wrote you an email too
E,Could use the ability to place the books where I want them on this app but otherwise it's very simple and easy to use
B,Bug.
E,Really annoying one.
B,"When I go to read a book I uploaded, sometimes it freezes in the midle of a chapter, and it only loads that one page, nothing before or after."
N,ArmagedonIt.
N,Now.
P,Excellent.
P,The best one for me.
E,"Simple, very useful tools and the best part : full syncrhonization across all my devices."

R,No books.

E,So slow!
R,Stop forcing us to have this app.
R,We should be able to have a choice to uninstall it completely or to keep it.
R,Please give us this choice.
B,Bookmark bug.
N,The app is fine except for how it takes a good 10-20 taps to remove the bookmark from a page.
B,It glitches out and the bookmark does not disapear.
E,Skim mode is a useless adition.
N,How do we disable it?
P,It's great
N,Night mode.
R,"The new update set the brightness to more than half, this is not a good idea for night reading you guys should bring back the night mode which was available in the old version also to follow system brightness and don't't make it set the brightness."
N,Still crap.
N,Still broke.
N,Still garbage.
N,I changed phones now all my notes and bookmarks take me to the title page.

N,Dictionary Language.
E,"New dictionary option is excellent, but use phone language."
R,Can ad an option to choose it?

E,Love the free kids books.
N,Jhakas.
N,Wonder
P,Love this app.
B,Gets annoying though when I have purchased a book and then when I go back into my library to read it again its not listed at all under my books so I have to go back into the store to find it again.
N,Id give it 5stars if it didn't have this problem
P,Like it.
R,I like the reader but an organization feature would be amazing.

P,Awesome.
N,This is what I want
B,Black Out.
E,I like the update 
B,but my main problem is after I read a few books I was off of it a few days and when I went back to read again now every time I pick a book the screen blacks out like its asleep but when you press the home buton the screen comes back on.
R,Would really like to read some more if it can be fixed will give more stars.
N,Pk yogi.
N,Raj
R,Needs Only One Improvement.
E,I love all the improvements.
N,Solved some problems I had using it.
R,But the read aloud offline voice needs to read more naturally.
E,It's too mechanical sounding.
N,CRAPPY BLOATWARE.
N,If I wanted this app I would have intalled it myself.
N,Tired of companies pushing their CRAPPY version of aps that you can't uninstall.
E,Useless waste of memory space.
P,Excellent ebook reader.
N,"In the past I used Aldiko to read my ebooks, but Play Books works even beter."
P,Love it!

P,Cool.
R,Great to have offline dictionaries.
N,Congrats Google.
P,Awesome.
E,The seamless integration is phenomenal from my phone to tablet
N,Will this ever integrate?
E,These readers take up so much space!
N,Will this integrate with Kobo and/or Kindle?
N,"I've purchased books on one platform, been gifted on another."
R,I just want one size fits all.
P,Great for consuming.
N,I use this app everyday to read between multiple devices.
E,Dictionary is a bonus.
R,Would like mobi suport tho.
P,Best eBook app we can have.
B,"Google is continuously evolving and updating but one issue is that it consumed too much data for downloading book, eg I uploaded 3 PDF books total size Aprox 80mb download statics showing data used by play books was 653 mb ?"
P,I love it!
P,It's excellent!
E,Nice look!
R,"I like this ap, but I liked more the colors you had before for highlight."
P,Amazing!
R,The offline dictionary was the only thing missing.
P,Now the app is by far the best e-reader for Android!
P,Good.
R,Good but need to make all books normal print
N,Worth.
N,I don't read much but this aps worth for 4 stars now.
P,Great app.
P,Worlds best ebook ap

N,Offline Dictionary.
R,"Finally, I've been waiting for this for a long time ."
N,Thanks google!
N,Yes!
N,Finally!
R,"Suport for offline dictionary,"
N,Google Play Books.
E,Love it if only there was so many books stores
N,Reading on the go.
E,Impressive!
R,"Once an average at best reader feature wise, is now becoming the best and smoothest experience out there."
N,Improvements keep coming and shows that Google can make great aps.
E,Smart
E,offline dictionary.
E,The offline dictionary is good!
E,interesting.
E,various books
E,New update is awesome!
N,Offline Dictionary?
E,Selection box is blank.
R,Need more offline features.
R,"After an update, it need to reload your library,  a pain and less font option too."
R,No sharing of notes.
E,Beautiful interface and nice adition of highlights and notes but how about exporting notes now?
E,"Also the upload of epubs document, a great idea, just doesn't work."
N,"Slowly geting there though, but as of now not yet really usable."
R,"Dec 19, 2014: one year later and still cannot share notes."
N,Why?
N,"They are already there, surely it's a two minutes programming work."
N,"Google is also cheating with the number of download, since it is forced download with every Android version."
N,Issues.
N,In the last update they STILL have fixed the bookmark isse.
B,In the latest iteration there are issues with the bookmark feature.
B,Removing a bookmark you have to tap the screen 3 or 4 times.
R,Still needs a lot of work to match Kindle app.
N,"As well, Android has generally poor reading aps compared to Aple aps.such as Marvin and the Kindle app on Aple is much beter than the Android version."
R,"Sory Android, but you need to up your game to be a real Aple alternative."
N,Note 3 (Sprint).

R,Shelves please .
E,Love the new update.
E,Looks great
P,Great for reading.
E,"The one app I use for reading books, with neat animations, card definitions and now offline dictionaries."
E,It's geting even beter.
B,"Fix the loading when fast turning pages though, with cpus we have, it shouldn't be a problem)"
P,Good
R,Offline dictionary please.
E,Updated rating as offline dictionary is now suported
E,Great app and gets beter w/updates.
N,I really like Google Play Books it lets me do everything I want to as I'm reading a book.
R,The only adjustment that I would yet make is when I open it up I wanted to be on my library not automatically defaults to curent books available.
B,Sometimes downloading a book into Google Play Books takes a long time even w/wifi.
E,But I do like the free dictionary that comes with it as well as the ability to highlight and notate anywhere in my pubs in that it saves those notations and highlights for me.
P,Awesome ap!
P,Love being able to read whilst offline
N,Not good enough!
R,"Please ad text mode (like Zinio),  it's useful to people who use 5~7"" tablets."
N,Allowing zoom-in as much as possible but avoid truncating on double-tap can be very handy as well.
P,Love it.
E,"A simple to use ap, does the job."
E,The book prices are just right and offline dictonary was much much needed.
N,Almost.
N,"I have a lot of ebooks as pdf's (courtesy of humble bundle), but it's slightly iritating that they all show up with that ""."
N,"pdf"" extension in the title."
E,Other than that minor nitpick it's prety good.
P,Almost Perfect.
P,I love this app.
R,I only wish it was beter at managing memory on the phone and that it could save to the SD card.
E,Lag though good
N,View seting.
R,It would be great if the Play Books had viewing feature that allows auto-adjustment of the page margins instead of zooming in on characters that's taped on.
N,Google.
N,I use Google for almost everything.
N,They haven't failed me yet.
N,Thank you.
B,Can't uninstall bloatware.
N,Not a bad app if this is what you want but if you don't want it it's constantly updating needs maintenance and takes up space and has invasive permissions
P,Great!
E,Love reading books on Google books!
E,Offline dictionary in setings is empty!
N,Not a reader.
N,Not an app I Use ok for those who read I guess
N,At last.
N,Finally!
N,They're here
N,It says my debit card details are not valid.
N,I live in South Africa.
N,So I can't download any books.
N,"""processing""."
B,"Trying to 'upload' epub files to the ap, but it constantly gets stuck at the 'processing' stage."
P,VERY FRUSTRATING!
R,Do something to store the downloaded books on SD card
P,Best ePub Reader.
E,This Ap has the best developed layout for the ePub format.
E,The ePub format is great for literature published by Jehovah's Witnesses because it allows for the integration of Bible verses and other references within the magazine or book.
N,Links to Bible verses are handled by a pop-up window.
E,The fonts and paragraph layout are very easy on the eyes.
N,Much thought has been given to how the average person reads.
E,"However, the required procedure of 'upload and process' before you open new literature is laborious."
N,Wow.
N,Option
N,Forced app once again.
N,Once again a forced app I don't want or need.
E,Memory using garbage I don't want.
N,Harold Robins

P,Excellent !
P,Lovely app keep your work up Google loved it :)
N,Pages from 2 chapters missing from download!
N,More than frustrating
N,Games.
N,Surbway surfas
R,Lacks some necessary features.
R,This is a good app for reading but it is missing some crucial features which should be there in a good ebook app.
N,"Firstly, the ability to organize your library."
N,Like what it shown when you first open the app.
N,"Ability to sort books into lists, etc."
N,What's not to like?
N,Zero problems.
N,I use it all time while waiting on people who's time is obviously far more valuable than mine.
N,Not a good idea to use app while driving.
N,Don't do that.
R,5 stars for Offline dictionary
P,Love Google Books.
E,I don't like the outdated icon but the aplication in itself is great
P,Loving.
E,Very handy& useful

B," but I do have a problem everytime I try to remove a bookmark, it just keeps coming back."
B,It takes almost five times of me touching the bookmark for me to be able to remove it.
N,Me
N,Adjustment.
B,The pages doesn't automatically adjust.
N,Which sucks.
P,Good one
N,Okay.
R,"I may try using this if i want to download a book, but I wish this was part of Google Play and not taking up extra memory."
N,Have Kindle and prefer it.
P,Superfluous!
N,Offline Dictionary FTW.
P,Extravagant.
N,Never find one beter than this
R,Can't remove this useless crock.
N,Samsung Galaxy S4.
R,Allow the debit card payments please.
R,its best only for the books i purchase from google play books.however i can't adjust font size of the books i personally downloaded
P,I'm in love.
E,I love the voice over text feature and I am overjoyed you folks included a dictionary into the ap
N,The Sacket Brand.

N,Oo nga daw iba tao aba iba wyw the same time as well as the most popular in the future and then the next couple run into any problems with it and it will not have a good day at work
P,Nearly Perfect.
R,"This is actually really good, but it gets only 3 stars for one simple reason that hasn't changed in 5 years: no ability to copy text."
R,"Otherwise, it would be 5 stars."
N,There's no point to not having the ability to copy/paste because anyone that wants to quote the work can simply read and rewrite the part they want to copy.
N,Just makes it REALLY annoying.
N,"It's not against copyright to copy small, relevant text for certain puroses (E.G. educational or commentary)."
N,"Other than that, works great and no problems."
N,I have only try to read one book so far.a dictionary would help I don't spell very well
N,goole play books.
P,i love this app.
P,"Good, but."
N,"After borowing a Nook for a litle while and reading on it, there's one feature they have that I miss while reading on Google Books."
E,"I really like having the ""x pages left in chapter"" on the status screen."
N,It let me know how far away from being at a good point to take a break I was.

R,Need more free books.
N,Where's all these scanned library books?
N,thanks
R,"Geting beter, but add a snails pace."
E,Books can't be biger than 100mb.
N,WTF.
N,Am I suposed to rip out the lymphatic system out of my anatomy book?
N,Or how about the entire section on musculature?
N,WOW.
R,This is also seriously needing text reflow.
N,"Well, at least they went from fail to 3 stars."
R,Why not make the API available to developers so we can use or favorite app with your services?
R,I would be nice to select single or dual page in landscape.
E,This material design is so cheap looking (Fisher price).
R,"Update: finally, offline dictionary!"
N,Extra star
E,Really slow.
E,Since recent updates there is significant lag and lockups.
P,I absolutely love it.
E,I really enjoy the fact that there are many free books as well as books under 10 dollars.

E,The monotone is annoying but can live with it.
N,Wonderful!
P,Best epub reader!
E,One of the beter aps out there and easy in use.

R,Would also be nice if the images could be enlarged when clicking on it.
R,"Also please ad the possibility to arange your books, ad them to a folder."
B,Since the last update there's a problem with the bookmarks.
N,"This being said, still a wonderful ap!"
E,Boring.
N,Can't install .
N,erh
N,Waste of time.

N,Reasons for Bipolar
N,Forced languages in categories :(.
N,This time otherwise smart google have done something very annoying and even bit insulting for Estonians.
E,A great service is ruined by forced russian language in book shop and categories.
R,The shop's language should be configurable.
N,What's the process to download a book on play store without a credit or debit card?
N,Runs a bit bollocks in Froyo.
N,"Here's a batshit-crazy idea, Google--don't release a new Android OS/APK every other month if it means throwing away your existing once-loyal customer base like yesterday's used Kleenex."
N,"Just sayin', it's kind of a jackass move against anyone who (1) is poor, or (2) actually cares about e-waste."
N,The press only pushes you so they have something to write about.
N,Be strong!
N,Very Disapointing :-(.
R,"If the books are available for free then why we need to provide credit/debit card info, just ad to user's library without any question !"
N,Disapointing >?<.
R,"If the books are available for free then why we need to provide credit/debit card info, just ad to user's library without any question !"
P,Great.
P,"I love being able to read books electronically, this app is the best."
N,Can't remove it.
N,This is boss.
N,Yeah
P,awesome googlee
R,Needs more options.
R,"No margin controls, and very litle font options."
N,Less is not always more !
N,Dictionary.
N,Thank you guys.
P,Almost perfect.
P,This app is near perfect.
R,The only issue that I have is that one cannot organize the books in their library manually.
R,This is something I would like to see in a future update
N,Constantly updes and I never use it.
N,Waste of memory and time
N,About recent update.
N,With these recent update.

R,It couldn't open some pages from the book that i'd bought
E,Beter on biger screens.
N,It's ok.
R,But it could be beter if.
N,H.                                                                                      well you.
N,figured that on your own
P,Hate this ap!
N,It only gives samples.
N,I know you have to buy it but its a waste of money you can just buy books at a store or wherever else
N,It's OK.
E,Other options are beter.
N,Amazon wins this one again for me I am afraid.
N,"It's not just about software, it's about the content and the portability of it once you paid."
N,Jawbone.
E,Interesting
N,Google play book
E,Slowest reader on market.

E,Game of thrones cannot use the offline dictionary
B,Causes system crash.
N,"Downloaded one book, no problems."
B,"Downloaded second book, system crashes and a message says UI system not working."
N,How do I fix this?
N,"It apears to affect the speed of access to aps, and I've paid for a book I can't read."
P,Love it.
R,I just took one star because it's hard to highlight something in the top of the page with the menu over the text you want to highlight!
N,Edit: issue has been fixed!
P,Excellent.
P,Excellent
N,Google app.
N,It's google what can be beter ?
N,Almost there!
N,This is geting very close to the same user experience as iBooks.
R,I've been using this mostly for ePub docs as I like to highlight most of my publications as I read them.
R,Would like the images to preview without being stretched and/or distorted.
N,"Works well on my Nexus 9 tablet and Nexus 5 smartphone :) A bit bugy on my iPad 2, could be my old iPad doesn't like iOS 8?"
N,I think it's geting a litle old to cope with the latest software.
N,Gy
N,Galaxy y. Nice ap

N,"Other than that, it's cool."
P,BEST.

E,this program has made all our aplication working so smoothly and faster.
N,this program is Master in real manner.

N,How exactly is the offline/online suposed to work?
N,"This was a feature I was looking forward to, but the instructions are unclear, and I tried using the option of having one, but it does not work."
N,No need.
N,I don't need some aps then why some system aps like this imposed as system app in android mobiles.
N,Nice ap
P,Don't like it.
N,I cannot find or see my books because of all their 'recommendations'.
N,It is nothing more than an ad on my phone IMO.

N,nice

N,Very.
P,Good
N,Flowing text not scalable.
B,I tried EPUB books from many different sources and neither of them is displayed properly.
E,"Flowing text is scaled down, then squeezed up on the first page (several columns of miniature pages) - its unreadable."
N,"EPUB format works fine in other readers, such as EPReader, so its definitely not my device."
P,Love to read books so I like it.
N,Offline dictionary finally!
N,What is up with Read Aloud feature.
E,Love that I can sync with phone and tablet flawlessly.
E,Love that I can highlight.
R,Annoying that i can't highight first line because the menu covers it.
P,Love that I can read PDFs.
R,Annoying that can't highlight or underline like a pdf reader.
E,"Love, love, love the read aloud feature Hate that it speaks like a robot and is super fast."
R,If this read aloud feature could speak in gogle navigation voice and you could control the speed at which it reads/speaks I could live with everything else and this would be a 5.

N,Great for quickly reader.
R,Need options for read and more tools for notes and comments
E,Nice Functionality.
N,"In the past, Google Books was ""playing catchup"" with other readers."

N,Don't.
N,Use it.never
N,Seep.
N,Menambah wawasan
N,Can't delete?
N,Why?
N,Can you tell me why I can't delete this useless ap?

N,I'm from the generation where I was told not to sit too close to the t.v!
N,Ha!
E,Useful.
N,Nice effort.
N,Keep it up guys ;:)
B,Not loading new books.
B,Since the last update it's stoped loading new books.

B,Needs to be fixed.
N,Scam.
N,Wont let me innstall
E,Bookmark is flaky.
N,It gets stuck on.
N,Will no longer load library without internet connection.
E,"This is my favourite reader ap, and the adition of pdf viewing was very welcome."
B,However since the latest update the library says it's empty when I open the app at a time when I have no internet connection.
N,I have a few downloaded books which should show up whether I'm connected or not.
P,I like it
P,Good but.
N,Hi.
B,Why my book in playbook with indonesia language can not be read by read aloud.
B,"The message ""read aloud unavailable""."
B,Please fix it.
N,Tx
P,This app is good.
N,Ok
N,Ok ok.
R,It does not suport epub files saved in the memory card.
N,I tried opening the file from with the file manager but it does not suport only works with samsung phones
N,I use a website that allows the downloading of stories and books writen by users.
N,This is the primary reason I use this app.
N,"Because of the formating of the website, the books do not have automatic covers."
N,"This means the vast majority of my library has blank, gray covers."
N,The default view does not allow for you to see titles.
N,"When I use the Kindle ap, this is not an issue; in the absence of covers, it makes the title a text only cover, which is very convenient."
N,Why can't this app do that?
N,Why you need my payment details for free books.
N,Why you need my payment details for free books.
N,Why should i trust my payment details with you.
N,Kindle works so much beter.

N,Bolehlah.
P,Very bad aps
R,Useful but still needs a few more features.
P,Overall a good app.
E,Offline dictionary is a good ad.
E,The ability to highlight PDFs is a must for me and one of the reasons that I'm still using Mantano Reader and not Google Books.
E,(Many books I have are PDFs) Also to share and export notes and highlights are very important and useful for me but is another reason I won't fully switch over and promote fully to others Google Play Books.
N,Ad these features Google and I'll gladly switch over.
P,Good job so far!
P,Realy good.
P,It's too good ap
N,Horizontal draging.
E,Draging when zoomed in is terible.
N,"Vertically it's fine, but horizontally there's a totally pointless threshold before it actually kicks in."
N,"Not really an issue for novels, but certainly won't be buying any comics until this is fixed."
N,How to upload my pdf.
R,Can you please show me.
N,The update.
B,"After the update I can't even read a single chapter completely it stops halfway, I have to go to the next chapter to continue reading but it does the same thing and for each and every book I downloaded."

N,as it is in kindle app.yet after update.there isn't a clue how to download offline dictionary
E,'Offline' is also a reality.
N,Why we have to download rasterized versions of original PDF files that already are on our devices?
N,To make that fliping effect possible?
R,"I want instant access to original files on my device, not the online copies."
P,Amazing
N,No download.
R,Bought books and just read i can't use it offline.bullshit
N,i love to read.
N,i have read many books thank you google for making it so simple
E,Decent.
N,There aren't a ton of books but I prefer this app over the kindle app.
N,Great app but why does it ask me to pay for a free book?
B,"Please fix, will rate 5 stars"
N,Offline Content?
N,"I ordered a bible, then I downloaded it so I can use it offline."
N,I opened play books to use it and it says I am not connected to the internet.
E,The epub is not accessable on this device.
N,I officially hate this app.
N,"Google has exacerbated me, again!"
R,Google Translate Plug in Please.
R,Please could you ad offline Google Translate plug in to Google Play Books .
N,Because Google Translate already has such an aplication.
N,Bookmark feature glitchy.
E,"Fantastic, really enjoying Google Play Books, one major flaw the bookmark feature will sometimes take 10-30 atempts to un-bookmark and only the 1 to bookmark, for someone like me who has not the luxury of none stop reading is incredibly annoying."
N,"If this is so not rectified soon, I shall unfortunately have to use an alternative."

E,The books are so lovely ihave kissed my wife 29years old in the KAMA SUTRA way lloovee
R,It  could be way beter.
N,Geting the books is fine but why is it so restrictive on how you read it its so hard to read.
R,"I can't change the font size, I can't have one of my books read aloud and the other has a robotic sounding lady reading that you can't understand."
N,Even trying to zoom in is difficult for no reason.
R,There should be a lot more customization in the app since I can't even read the books from any other aps.

E,The file uploading feature for long PDFs is still a bit wonky.
E,"The reading view is much nicer than Kindle, but functionality is just not on pair with Amazon."
E,Good for everyday use; a litle short on accessibility.
E,Landscape two-column view can't be disabled.
E,And resizing to large font sizes sometimes takes a long time.
N,(I guess narow column widths make page layout a harder problem?)
E,"On the bright side, the font size doesn't seem to be limited."
E,The book is great!
E,I love Poe's way of writing!
R,"The update needs an ""update""."
E,I like the new layout; it is easier to manage my books.
N,"However, anytime I try to make notes or bookmarks and then remove them, they will not go away until I try at least five different times."
B,Please fix this glitch.
B,Force closes.
P,I love having books handy.
B,"But when I go to adjust the text size, it stops working and an eror message comes up."
N,Hoping this new update works.
P,Awesome
E,Functional
P,great
E,Organization is lacking.
R,"There's a lot to like about Google's ebook service, but they need to upgrade organization functionality."
N,"I have several hundred books uploaded, and they're a jumbled mess."
R,I want to be able to organize them into folders/shelves.
N,This feature would make it a 5-star app.
N,#Good
N,Frustrated.
N,I love this reading app I buy all my books through the playstore but I'm so frustrated that I keep reading through books to find that 2 or more pages at the end of a chapter arnt there until I have to restart everything and sometimes they show up again sometimes they don't.
N,It has recently started doing this so I hope it can be fixed!
E,Barely usable.

R,Please allow the user to configure how long the menus remain visible before retracting; they disapear too soon.
R,Please allow the user to turn off or relocate the dictionary.
N,It often covers up what I am trying to highlight.
R,There seems to be no way to highlight across page boundaries.
E,Chapters' indication of curent reading position is not always shown.

N,(Android 5.0.1 on Nexus 7)

P,I love this app and i use it sometimes to read pdf files.
N,Any sugestions in fixing this issue?
N,Italy.
N,It was OK  I give it
P,Good things and frustrating things.
B,I've recently started buying books off Play Book and it's been a breeze so far.
B,But there are times when it skips pages so i have to close app and restart again.
R,I also wish i could edit the Notes straight from the drop down menu instead of the app taking me to the page where i marked the note.
R,"I just want to update info, not go to that page."
N,"And of course, the bookmarks."
N,Geting rid of it is like the bigest challenge of all.
B,It disapears and reapears after pressing it again and again.

N,Not a great reading experience.
E,I found it annoying to turn the page and page view goes to default.
N,I have to zoom to get to the desired page view.
R,"I think, the zoom ought to be retained after page turn in the landscape mode."
R,Please sort this out ASAP.
N,Elegant 3d page turn doesn't mater if basic reading gets annoying.
N,"The books are priced very well but if I am not geting simple hassle free reading, I may not buy any books at all and may not use this app after I am done with my book."
N,Finishing the book purchased has become a challenge.
N,Ew so grows.
N,Hahahahah
P,Good
R,Need more improvements.
E,(1) The tabs to select text to highlight are too small.
E,(2) Images are not rendered with accurate proportions.
N,"(3) If a book have a lot of footnotes, at the end of each chapter I have to scroll trough many footnotes pages before I can get to the next chapter."
N,It was ok.
N,But you have to buy it
P,Awesome never seen one before!
R,Could be beter than great!

E,Terible Ereader.
E,My normal ereader  is moon but I had to use this one because the book I wanted was cheapest here.

N,Can't download it
N,Dekstop
E,Text quality is bad.
E,The worst implemented feature of this app is the aspect of text after some degree if zooming.
E,"On a large 10"" tablet the text is too small and there are big black margins so a litle zoom would be just fine."
E,"However, the text looks blured and does not scale properly, it is no match to adobe reader."
N,nOt bad
E,It beautiful
N,Defining words no longer works reliably.

N,I don't have to give a cc # for that :-)
P,Love to read!
R,I just wish I could find books that are on Kindle on this app so I don't have to have two accounts.
P,"It's good, but."
N,"For only 6 not-even-long books that I keep on my phone, this app has taken 5 GB of the phone's storage!"
N,They're mostly just plain text!
N,What's the deal here?
N,Galina cute.
P,I like it!

N,I used to like this app until recently.
N,Brightness control changed without me doing anything and it took a while to figure out how to change it back.
N,"But worst of all, reading mode on my samsung tablet no longer functions with this app."
N,Disapointing.
N,This app and other aps of Google are not available in Puerto Rico.
B,Disabled them makes the phone and table slower.
N,Great reader but was beter before.
E,This was an excellent full featured eReader.
N,Worked as well as nook or kindle.
E,"Then the Android 5 update came out and the interface became less user friendly, and the app became very lagy."
N,It can take 3-4 minutes to open a book now.
N,B. H
N,Google Play Books.
P,Awesome.
N,But takes up a lot of space.
R,"Good, but could be beter."
N,Google Play Books is slowly catching up with the other books aps.
R,"The book store itself is a weak link - need the ability to manage wish lists for books, see best seller lists and expert reviews."
E,The one nice feature is the ability to read aloud any book - but the feature doesn't work with the screen turned off and drains the batery.
P,Google -Andriod Aps.
N,"You know why I love google, why I am such an advocate of google?"
E,"Besides the facts of having done more and given more resources to the working class than any corporation on earth, past or present."
N,But Aditionally because things ALWAYS WORK.
N,"The same way, every time you click the buton."
N,It's such a JOY to use and work with.
N,Software where you can focus on the issue at hand without the need to focus on geting the software to work the way it should.
N,"Software is a TOOL, it's a tool that enables ""we the people"" to get work done faster, with beter quality, and beter results than ever before."
N,Google Makes That Easy.
N,"Whether you are working with data and graphs, images and movies or just writing a document inserting both of the above."
N,Google Makes It EASY.
N,That's the way software is suposed to work.
N,That's the way it works when your developers know what they are doing.
N,"Kudo's to Google and all who work at google for bringing a vision to life, and simplicity to our workdays, and once again, for always giving THE BEST to the people!"
N,N. B
N,It is the MOST important BOOK for me.
N,And it safe life.

E,Convenient app.
E,It is a very good tool.
E,The only two things I don't like are that it keeps ading a bookmark when I try to remove it and the use of the dictionary.
B,It took about 5 atempts before it would allow me to remove a bookmark.
R,"Also, I would like it if the dictionary feature was more reliable."
B,"Most times when I select a word, the definition doesn't come up like it used to before I updated the app."
P,Love it.
P,I love reading books and I love this ap!
P,The best ebook reader.
E,Being able to sync the books I'm reading to my devices is very useful.
R,"I will ad the remaining star when the browser app gets more features, such as remembering font setings for a book and allowing different color schemes (news articles are saying the computer's blue white light is bad for to use before going to sleep)."
P,very bad.
N,I cannot believe that Google make so bad app.
E,The text is not clear in my tablet Motorola Zoom.
N,What is hapening with this ap?

N,Pot a Hindi magamit bobo
N,It is ok app.
R,It would be beter if the text was not in this weird looking font.
E,"Every time I see these, I cancel the book, because it is annoying!"
R,"And I want to see full complete pages of my books, not scrolling 5 times to read a single page, this is awful!"
B,"Once the book is uploaded, why does it replicate the book again when I click the epub file ?"
R,It should be smart enough to avoid uploading duplicates of the same books.
B,Please fix those issues but leave the rest intact.
P,Lovely.
P,Amazing

N,This game is okay.
N,Cause when I want to read something so I click the sample.
B,The sample does not represent the whole book it just shows a bit.

N,Hey google.
B,My LG phone is having serious problems loading this app.
N,I have been using this particular app for two years and I've had no problems.
N,Would you have any guesses why?
N,"At first I thought it was my WiFi connection, but most of those books are downloaded to my phone."
N,So if you know any plausible explanations I would love to hear them.
E,Promising.
B,The app is going in right direction but there is a major bug.
B,I've uploaded 3 epubs till now and in every case lots of pages are missing.
N,"If I open the same epub in moon+, or on my computer via Caliber or even play books on Web, I see those pages but not with the app."
B,"If you open the missing pages on Web and come back to ap,  it shows the pages."
N,Also I've already downloaded the dictionary for offline use but it still goes on downloading and then stops in between and stuck in between.
B,Hapens randomly.
E,Not very accessible.
N,I have 2 google accounts with books dbin both - 1 for novels and 1 for work.
B,Very annoying that I constantly need to re download books all the time- would be great to work like email and have multiple accounts linked so didn't need to waste so much time (and data) redownloading books and trying to find where I was up to.
N,Raza.
N,Ok
N,Cannot logout
P,Awesome.
P,Awesome
N,Why do you this to me Google?
R,I have really bad eye sight and i can't chamge the font size.
P,Love love love it
P,Great.
