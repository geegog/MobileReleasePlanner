N,Just download it already!
P,Soo good!
N,There are so many things good about this app but to name a few Fun!

E,"Efficient (can use your dead time, ie public transport in London)."
E,It has never been so easy to learn a language.
E,More fun than most app games.
R,"I love to ""play"" Duolingo but I wish it had the vocabulary feature that the full computer version has."
E,nice graphics and methods to learn
P,AWSOME APP.

P,Loved it
P,Best.
N,Languages app.
E,Can become quite adictive!
P,excellent app for language learners.
E,It is very nice concept.
E,Overall it's a really good app that suits different learning styles.
N,Perfect if you have a few gaps throughout the day.
N,"Only down sides so far is that some games start by asking you to translate words before teaching you the meaning, so you will score lower."
N,A dictionary might do the trick though.
E,Another issue I found is that some audios are not well recorded so it can be more challenging.
N,I definitely recommend this app anyhow!
N,A problem.
N,When I finished basics 2 but still it did not gave me lingtos and next lesson was also not unlocked please fix it
E,It is not as good as the web version.
B,"First problem it uses a 'heart' system and you are allowed 4 mistakes, after which you fail and have to start from the beginning."
B,"Problem is that Duolingo uses a list of corect answers, and some corect answers are not on the list."
N,It is also prety savage marking against typos.
E,"The web version just knocks you back, but not out, if it decides you are wrong, and you can feed back why you think your answer should be accepted, this feedback helps improve the answer list."
E,The app is a fallback but not as good
P,"Verg good,."
R,"Lovely ap, just need to do it more often."
E,No real.
B,Bugs or anything.
N,We'll designed.
N,Best way to keep in touch.

P,Loved it.
P,Good with minor flaws.
N,It is not all words are right especially in French and it would be really fun to learn Russian :)
E,An interesting ap!
R,But still needs implementation.
R,"In English for Vietnamese speakes, there is no exercise for learners to practice their pronunciation skill."
E,"Furthermore, in translation exercises, although some translated sentences have the same meaning with the corect answer, they are considered as a wrong answer."
N,It makes me feel unpleasant sometimes!
R,5 stars if you atach an in-ap keyboard of the same language that one is learning
E,"Program is great, app needs work."
E,Duolingo is a great program for learning languages and works really well.
B,"The only issue I have is with the ap, which doesn't show you lesson notes (which are available on the desktop version)."
N,You're kind of just thrown into a quiz without knowing what you're doing and its trial-and-error until you figure it out.
N,The grammar isn't explained to you at all.
E,You're better off using the website for actual learning and suplementing with the app for practice.

E,"Other than that, this app makes it fun and easy to learn the languages they do have."
E,Adicting and makes learning fun!
N,"Starting off reviewing German, a language I studied in my youth."
E,The app is fun and uses video game like mechanics and an experience point system of rewards to keep you interested and practicing.
N,As you learn new words the app keeps older words in the mix and keeps track of when you start to forget them.
N,"Your ""power"" for mastery of those words that you start to forget drops and you should go back and review to boost your power back up."
N,"DuoLingo provides multiple modes of learning - hearing the words in context and having to repeat them audibly into a microphone, writing the English or German equivalent translations for phrases, completing sentences, flash card based practice, and an interesting translation section called ""Immersion"" where you can translate user suplied articles in real time with other learners, providing feedback on each other's translations one sentence at a time."
E,There are also feedback and forum sections to dispute or discuss the relative merits of each question you are presented with.

N,duolingo.
N,beneficial to all ages and all levels of learning
P,Great Ap.
P,"I've been using the app just for French thus far, so I can't speak on behalf of the other languages available, but so far I've found it to be a great learning tool."
E,It gives the information on variety of ways and presents it so that it is easy to understand and learn.
N,"Having it on my phone makes it easy to do when I have a few spare minutes too, which I think is essential to making time to practice a language."
N,Ok.
N,I've noticed that when it asks to say what the word or words are it usually says no lets move on.
N,I've also noticed it gives incorect definition for words.
B,There quite a few glitches it needs to be fixed.
N,"When I tap on the French way to say it, I put it just as the words say and it tells me I'm wrong."

P,Amazing.
N,I can't believe how much I've learned in just a week.
E,This is such a wonderful ap!
N,Duolingo is a great way to learn language basics.
N,I am polishing up on my Spanish and next it will be French.
E,Wonderful and it's free!
N,Funciona bien y es entretenida de usar
N,Been using duolingo over 2 weeks now I'm level 7 learning spanish.
N,Can't really speak much from memory yet but I have a few phrases memorized and i can figure out a lot of the material based on context clues.
N,"I've also been using Memrise, which is free as well, but there seem to be subtle to major differences in the basic venacular that make it confusing to use the two at the same time."
N,"Anyways, it's a great app I enjoy using it so I thought I'd rate it so it would stop asking me."
E,Great for it's service!
N,Duolingo is (like most other services like it) constantly ading on to it's library.
N,"Initially it started with only 5 languages for English speakers when I downloaded it and with a growing community of suporters it has grown, as well."
N,"Many of the languages that in progress for duolingo are not visible on mobile and there are languages being constantly aded to it's ""incubator"" so don't wory if a specific language isn't on here for you!"
E,"Considering it is free, duolingo excels!"
N,O m??todo poderia ser melhor.
N,Quando estudamos uma l??ngua o fundamental ?? aprendermos a entend??-la sem traduzir.
N,Infelizmente com o duolingo isso n??o ?? poss??vel.
N,Ele usa esse m??todo ineficiente da tradu????o literal.
N,"Ao traduzir algumas frases, ??s vezes, transcrevo a frase em ingl??s, sem querer, porque entendo a frase sem precisar traduzir."
N,"Por isso, ao meu ver, o duolingo ?? muito bom para iniciantes, mas para quem est?? acima do n??vel intermedi??rio, o m??todo de sempre traduzir tudo irita um pouco."
R,This app is perfect but I speak English and I want to learn Japanese.
R,Can you make changes please?!
P,Great aps.
R,"wish to have Japanese, Korean and other language to learn in the future ;-)"
E,It is very fun.
N,It's makes learning a language really fun!
N,And it motivates you to keep learning it.
N,Duolingo.
N,I am using this as well as another program.
E,It has really been helpful.
E,Fun and easy to use.
P,"Seamless integrated into my daily routine, love it"
N,I'm gonna learn Spanish or French wewe
P,Good!
N,They are really good at teaching you languages
N,Good for consistant learnjng and training.
N,"If you want to consistantly train yourself with foreign language and you are a smartphone edict, you have a big chance!"
N,Once you start to use English you can try European options.
P,This is a really great app.
R,I like this app a lot it's really useful for learning languages but one thing that I think it needs is more stuff to buy in the store like maybe more clothes.
E,Fun and easy to stick with.
P,Absolute best way to learn another language.
P,This is an amazing and inspired app.
N,I have never been able to not only learn a new language but also understand it in the depth that Duo lingo provides.
N,I fund myself wanting to come back everyday and watch my XP meter rise and my progress visually grow in front of my eyes.
N,It is not only that but it seems like every difficulty regarding learning a new language has been accounted for such as fading memory.
E,The comments and community are also great and very friendly not to mention helpful!
N,You must try it!
P,Love it
P,Fantastic!
N,"I thought this would be like all the other ""free"" language aps, but it isn't and is completely and totally free!"
E,"It's really effective too, I've only done a few lessons in German and (with some background grammar knowledge) I can already say a few basic, but common/useful, phrases!"
N,"Once I'm done German, I'm gonna do French and then Spanish."
R,"I really hope they keep ading more, as I would really like to learn something like Mandarin or Russian."
N,"Also, built-in grammar lessons and vocab flash cards."
P,Great ap
P,Great app.
R,Why not find a way to make this available offline/off-network?
N,I commute using public transport to and from the office.

N,"A few years ago, my husband bought a year's subscription to Roseta Stone (RS) for me, but with our busy schedules, I never found much time to sit at the computer."
N,"Due to time constraints, I didn't learn much."
N,I downloaded Duolingo a few days ago and have almost reached the point where I left off with RS!
N,They use similar teaching techniques but the mobility of Duolingo makes it far better than RS.
P,+ it's free!
P,Great Ap.
N,I really enjoy this app.
R,"It could give you a litle more freedom with mistakes, but it fuctions perfectly and is a great tool!"
N,Learning spanish.
P,I like the app in general.
N,"I started the English to Spanish course, after already taking Spanish 1, and noticed some things that I knew but the app didn't explain clearly."
N,"For instance, the app teaches you 'comer' and 'beber' (to eat and to drink) as the first spanish infinitives you learn and doesn't clearly explain why or how it changes depending on the subject."
N,This wasn't a problem for me but I could see how things like this would confuse someone who is completely new to spanish.
P,Overall a good app.
P,Love it.
N,Good way to practice
P,Best free app to learn languages!
P,I love this app and have been using it almost everyday for a week.

P,Great.
N,"Help in classes,and in general"
P,Amazing.
N,"It allows you to learn at your own pace, much faster than high school Spanish class."
E,The duolingo community is also very suportive.
N,you are serious about learning a new language I also recommend memrise for vocabulary.
N,??Buena suerte!
P,Splendid.
N,It will lead you to a wide understanding of the selected course omly if you put in ayleast 15 minutes minimum a day
P,Great!
N,BUT.
R,I wish they would have some sort of introduction before each new lesson!
P,"Otherwise, fantastic ap!"
P,Love it!
N,I wish this program was around when I had to take a foreign language in school - I might have lasted more than one semester!
E,very useful.
N,"A nice natural way to learn language, gradually intoducing more complexity as you go along."
N,LG Optimism Exceed 2.
N,"Won't let you register without Google+, I don't want my G + name on Duolingo."

P,This app is great.
N,My French grades went up because of it.
N,"However, you can't learn Portuguese."
N,You learn /Brazilian Portuguese/ which is the Portuguese spoken in Brazil.
N,"I'm only complaining because I have some English-speaking friends who'd love to speak Portuguese but I still wouldn't understand them if they did, because, believe it or not, Brazilian Portuguese is very different from Portuguese."
P,Great app for learning new languages!
P,I really love this app.
N,"I am using this app to learn Italian, French, Portuguese, and Spanish."
N,"So far after 2 months of using Duo, I can say basic sentences."
N,"The reason why I gave Duolingo 4 stars, though, is because there aren't very many languages, sometimes the pronunciation is off, and they sometimes don't have the sentence right."
N,"Over all, Duolingo has helped me and you should definitely download it."
N,Muito bom :).
N,Parabens aos desenvolvedores
E,A bit repetitive.
N,"And doesn't let me put accents in,  despite me having a Spanish keyboard enabled."
