E,"Calling was a bit janky, but it was a rather solid experience, nevertheless."
N,"However, now, thanks to some new update, i spend more time waiting for texts to send and the app to stop crashing (for enough time to do anything) than actually texting."

P,Awesome.
N,I've been using Textplus for over a year by now.
N,Never had problem with it.
N,Now I can text with my American friends too :)
P,Great.
E,It works amazingly
P,Good app.
N,Don't give it 5 stars because sometimes my messages won't go through or send them really late.
E,Also I don't like that when you send out a picture the other person gets an email to look up the picture.
R,I wish it was sent and seen like a regular message would receive it.
E,Other than that it's good it's free and not complicated and EASY to log into.
N,Put money to ad minutes and one it won't let me make any calls.
B,It does not work
P,Really good.
N,K
N,No pics.
N,It will let me send out pictures but i cannot receve any y?
N,A lot of times i have to send a text two or three times because they won't go through.
B,Fix this problem and my rate will go up :)
N,It's almost a waste.
N,It's only free user to user and after hearing how my phone acted or didn't act after a convo they were like hell naw to a user request.
N,If i wasn't still on a minute phone this would be a waste of time.
N,Your call might get through.
N,ang galing.
P,love it
N,"""Your device does not suport real time push notifications."""
N,THIS IS NEW!
N,"And BTW, it did before the last 3 updates!"
N,"YOUR FAULT, NOT MINE!"
N,Figured it out myself.
N,"Suport was useless, bordering on inept."
B,"UPDATE: the problem is as follows - Text+ is unable to push notifications across wifi in even remotely close to real time, regardless of connection speed."
N,Cellular connection only!
N,This makes the app almost pointless for me.
N,"When I can't get a clear cell signal @ home, I would like to use my 300mb/50mb wifi to send and receive texts."
N,Is that too much to ask in 2015.
N,Fix this issue and earn customers for life.
N,"Otherwise, I'm out!"
B,It doesn't even work on my phone!
N,It's not even leting me sign in my account at all.
N,"I had this app on my old phone, and it worked excellent."
N,"I buy a new phone, I get this app."
B,And it doesn't work at all.
N,Could use some work but ok.
R,The things that need Improvement are completely clear.
N,"Download and run the ap, you'll see."
N,It is not awful just ok
N,Dissapointed.
N,Have used this app for almost two years.
B,Now it says it eill not connect because i am not connected to an internet connect.
N,Which is not true.
N,Screw this app.
N,I will not use it again.
N,Text plus.
P,Cool
N,Text Plus v5.9.9.
N,It works when I am on WiFi and does a perfect job of messaging.
N,The app needs to be open on my phone to get notification of new messages.
N,It does chunk the messages to smaller pieces if you have a lot to say.
N,Text plus.
N,Free text and talk plan.
N,No 1 app for texting!
P,It is not bad.
N,One of the better aps for free text.

N,Call and txt
P,Great.
N,School doesn't block it so can actually talk
N,Yay.
N,Boo boo
E,"Good service, but has a lot of bugs."
N,"It splits up the texts that people send me in random spots, and rearanges them so I have to figure out what order they go in."
E,It's so confusing and annoying sometimes.
N,And a lot of the time I can't get calls to even dial at all.
N,I'm not hapy with this.
N,No internet?
N,It do need it ?? I hate it
N,Don't ask me no more today to rate
P,Cool.
N,I mean it is cool but when I try to send a pic.
N,the other person can't see it and it sucks when I try to call

N,Bill saver.
N,Having free inbound calls and free text messages saves me big on my bill.
N,I will keep this app as long as they keep it activated.
N,They give you minutes for watching videos and downloading games.
N,You need WI-FI or some kind of Internet but we'll worth it for me!
N,No one can hear me.
N,I have 100 mb/second internet And folks telling me my voice keeps cuting off.

N,I used the app on Samsung S4.
N,"Short time later I was asked to log in again, none of my crudentials at this time were recognized by text plus."
E,"Customer suport was useless and not very responsive, it took many days to hear back from them and they still were not able to help me log in."
N,"For all the permissions that I gave this ap, don't waste your time"
P,Best there is no comparison.
N,Thanks great app nicely done on all aspects

E,Calls are garbage what's the point of going through the headache to get credits if half of them are spent trying to get other person  to hear after it cuts out for a period of time!
P,Great.
E,The calls aren't free at all and people can't hear me on the other end sucks
P,Loved it.

P,I hate it!
N,I can't figure it out!
N,Deletes long texts.
N,This app splits most of my incoming and outgoing text and most of the time I receive only the second half of it.
N,So frustrating and I'm not trusting it anymore.
N,Also takes ages to send and receive which I am OK with considering its a free app.
P,Amazing.
N,I'm so glad this app let's me text my friends and call for FREE!
E,I love this app except it only gives you a limited time calling

N,It asked for a lot at the begining to and I don't know my password.
P,Love It.
P,Best thing in my life
N,You need your phone service or WiFi smh??????.
N,Ppl this is not what you think it is i thought I can used my minutes on the app when my phone gets cut off a wrong it said I needed net work connection or wifi smh not worth downloading.
N,Unless you wanna call someone who blocked you like your ex to stalk and don't want them to know it's you lol other then that I rather pay my bill and text on my regular number phone or you can go to a place where they have free WiFi like McDonald's.
E,but I'm very disapointed and dissatisfied about this scam app.

N,Please reply or upgrade this to change or if you can tell me how to once again please reply

N,Question and something to say.
N,Hi why would you make a log out buton cause I accedently pressed it and I had to delete Text+ and reinstall it and sign in again.

N,Thanks!
N,"It is very good, never any problems with text/picture messages."
N,Annoying.
N,Goes to unwanted PlayStore aps trying to get you to install them.
N,Free or cheap.
N,"You claim in the start that one can text or call for free anywhere in the world, but when you read more you're claim changes to cheap text and calls in united states and Canada."
R,"Please drop the cheap tricks and JUST say what you mean in the beginning, we won't hold THAT against you!"

N,What I don't like about it is that I cannot receive pictures from anyone who is not using this app.

B,It won't let me uninstall it
N,It works Great most of time.
N,This is an app I've had on all my droids for years now and I have to say it's probably the most useful app I have.
N,It works great for text and calls 90% of the time.
E,"Lately though it's been drawing a lot of batery power, really hope this is a bug they fix soon!"
N,"It's OK only because it misses calls way too often even when I check off incoming calls, and have credits doesn't notify me until I actually check myself."
B,It needs to fix the notifying part because laging is to prevalent.
N,Other than that its great
N,RJA.
P,Outstanding app.
N,It allows me to keep in touch with family.
N,It was OK but it had a few mistakes
E,Worthless.
N,You can't call on this gay app.
B,This doesn't work if I were you I would not get this game
N,It's ok.
E,Hey I like it but it can be annoying
N,So I loged out.

N,Beast.
P,This is a good game
E,Uses too much memory.
N,I used this app for a month or so because I have a Tracfone and I'm running out of text messages available.
N,"It worked great for sending texts to anyone, and even receiving texts."
N,"However, it is a memory hog."
E,"This app runs slowly, and makes everything else on my phone agravatingly slow."
N,I even found it using 90 megabytes of memory one day!
E,No more slowing my phone down!
P,Good app.
N,This is a good app as long as you have WiFi
B,Always closes.
N,I RARELY write a review but I'm really mad.
B,If you leave the app and go back to it it closes down and restarts.
E,It's super frustrating.
