E,Lame app with poor design.
E,Ap acquires sensitive permissions that are NOT required for its stated functions.
N,Check app permissions!
N,It can access and read your CONTACTS as well as IDENTITY/ACCOUNTS on your phone!
N,WHY?
N,WHAT ARE THEY DOING MINING YOUR PRIVATE DATA?
N,Can you say SPYWARE?
E,Too big to fail is also too big to care about respecting their customers privacy or puting out a quality app.

N,Really?
N,What a load of turd!
N,chase app.
N,"pri,chase app."
N,Can't Deposit Checks.
N,"When you open to take a picture, the app instantly takes the picture without giving a change to get the check lined up."
B,The AP is broken.
N,it use to work.
N,I un-installed and re-installed.
N,but no luck.
N,Now I need to go to the ATM.
N,Check deposit.
N,Isn't the whole point of e-check deposit to make the process more efficient.
N,"Rather, I have to wait until the next day for funds when I can get instant cash in person?"
E,Unacceptable.
N,AMBASSADRESS MOORE.
P,LIKE
N,Waste of time.
E,It is worse than ever before.instead of going ahead you guys are going back.do something right.
E,Quick deposit does not work with galaxy tab 4.
N,"Just talked with a chase rep, who told me the reason the quick deposit won't connect to the camera is because the camera doesn't have the right auto focus feature needed."
N,Be aware.
P,It work awesome
P,The best.
N,I can view all of my accounts right from my phone and tablet
N,Hides due date for credit cards.
N,Makes it ridiculously difficult to see the due date for your credit cards.
N,"Shows the balance on first page, but it's 2-3 more taps on each account to see when due."
N,Makes it seem like they want you to miss a payment.
N,A very bank of America thing to do.
N,I thought chase was better than that
E,It is easy does it.
N,Good app to have if you don't have time to be going to the bank and make payments.
E,It is easy to use
N,Sign in problem.
N,Everytime i try to sign in into the app it tells me i have to do it on the computer whats the point of the app if i can't sign into it.
N,CHASE ROCKS.
N,I have no problems accessing my accounts.
N,Best way to do Banking
N,Location.
N,Finding an ATM/branch is absolutely a disaster.
R,Also not being able to take screen shots isn't necessary
N,Chase works!
P,"This app is a great app to have, especially the swipe right feature."
P,Great.
N,Let's me know what I need to know and fast
P,Love Chase!
N,"For those who seem to blame Chase for their phone's malfunction, I can honestly say that I have not had 1 issue with their services and Chase listens to complaints and updates accordingly."
N,"Keep up the great work, Chase!"
N,Zero functionality compared to AMEX and capital one.
N,This is the most spartan app I've even seen.
R,"Missing recent activity, available credit, and so much other basic information it's just about worthless."
N,Unreal to see an app like this in 2015 especially compared to ones like AMEX the are cuting edge.
P,Great Ap.
E,Convenient.
E,The notifications are helpful!
P,Great app.
R,The thing i wish it always showed is the Dallas background when loging in.

N,So waow!
N,Incredible
E,Great updates.
E,The app looks and functions great.
N,annoyed customer.
B,the app works well in some areas but the main reason i liked the app  dose not even work right.
R,can't deposit the check and the stupid camera dose not focus like its suposed to.
E,its not my phones fault because its separate camera works extremely well.
B,please fix.
P,Great app.
E,It is easy to use.
E,Convenient for transfers and checking balances.
N,Still no pending charges total?
N,It's prety disapointing that after all the iterations and the major redesign that we still can't see a line total of pending charges on a credit card account.
R,It really should be right next to the curent balance.
N,"I guess I'm a litle dramatic with the 2 star rating - its a great app otherwise, which makes this seemingly simple disapointment puzling and frustrating."
P,Good banking.
N,Makes life easier
P,Awsome i love this ap
N,I give the chase app a 4.
E,It's fast and never freezes on you
N,Nice.
P,I love this

N,Superior Mobile Ap.
E,First rate.
P,Good.
P,It is very very good
N,It really works.
N,Okay could be better.
R,It would be great if they aded fingerprint log on for the quick preview.
N,For more security.
B,Fix the deposit issue!
N,Ok but.
R,I'd like to see this made so you can edit from your phone.
N,That way when you have checks sent out you can deduct them so you can see what all is going out instead of having to balance a check books from this app.
N,Make it available to do all thru the app.
E,Deposits get Borked.
E,Prety bad that a HUGE financial cannot seem to keep a simple app updated!
B,Major problem using the check deposit feature.
B,It basically doesn't work on my LG G3.
B,FIX please.
N,Otherwise it's a '5 star' app.
E,Yeah this app is usless.
N,So I don't have a chase atm or branch near my university for about 60 miles so I'm trying to deposit my checks with this app but I have called them and I have reinstalled the app and I been patient with it but this app can't deposit checks.
N,You can use it to check you're balance but not for depositing checks.
N,I knew it was too good to be true.
N,Now I have to mail my checks to my mom like wtf!
P,I loved.
N,This app help me a lot thanks
N,Snap shot feature.
N,What hapened to being able to slide to the right to see a snap shot was that removed?
B,Eror.
B,I can't seem to get an identification code so I can't login and see my account
E,Depositing checks doesn't work.
B,"Every time I try to deposit a check using the ap, it says ""problem connecting to the camera"" (my camera works just fine)."
N,And there is no way to report bugs!
N,Now I remember why I uninstalled this crapy app 2 years ago--it just doesn't work right!
N,Ver.
B,3.2 chase card payment crash.
B,Can't pay bills since update.
B,"Ap just ""stops"" and exits badly."
N,Used to work great.
N,Test much?
N,Smh.
N,It won't let me click on my account when I go to mobile deposit a check.
N,I've Uninstaller the app amd redownloaded it twice.
B,Still doesn't work
P,Love iy
P,Good app.
N,Offers same features as the Website.
N,Services.
N,Keep up the good job
E,Non-quick deposit.
N,Can't make a deposit after last update .
N,still.
N,is it ever going to work again?
N,Still same thing 2 years later with my Samsung Note Edge.
N,It says it can never get a clear enough picture and to try again.
P,Great.
E,"Easy, functional, clean."
N,Cant use quick deposit feature always says can't connect to chase wtf thats the only reason I want this ap
B,Crashes.
B,Force closes everytime I want to look up statements.
E,Best looking app made by a bank
N,Never had problems but .
N,"To the people complaining about screenshots, its a security measure."
N,You can easily use your same phone to log into your account ONLINE instead and everything SHOULD show up there  and than screenshot that.
E,"But for me, I don't like how auto pay bills are due on a certain date, but don't show up processed til 3 days later."
N,But if I had waited to pay it 3 days later I would get a late overdraft fee on my account for not paying the deducted amount within a day after the due date.
N,It's not lined up corectly.
B,It doesn't work at all.
B,The app just doesn't work.
N,Waste of time to download and install it.
R,It works fine but no payment due date.
P,How can something like this me overlooked?
R,"I use the app exclusively, but it doesn't show the payment date."
N,Can't function this way
E,It is easy to use.
P,Great app.
N,Online deposit.
N,"I live very far away from my bank and I only receive paper paychecks, and the online deposit takes forever."
N,It's been over 24 hours and it still hasn't posted.
N,The feature says it will processed the same day if deposited before 11 pm this is complete bull malarkey.
R,"Still, no screenshots allowed, less secure login."
B,"During login when I type my username, the keyboard shows possible matches."
R,I think this should be off like my other bank accounts.
N,"Also, I cannot take a screen shot of my payment with this app."
N,I can with my other card aps.
N,It works great on galaxy3 nicely.now i have an LG we will see.
B,Right now it won't download.
P,Bad.
R,I can't deposit a check.
N,"It says limit is 2,000 uh ya I know."
N,"I tried  to deposit a 1,800.99  check  and then it said i can't deposit it."
N,Why not?
N,"It is less than 2,000, not 18,000."
N,I also can't type a comma so that doesn't help
P,Great ap

N,So far I'm liking this app I can actually get to my bank acct.
N,Now
N,OMG.
N,This app worked perfect until I got a new phone.
N,now it won't let me put my user name or password in its saying it's not rite.bull.
N,I was really hapy to have this app bc I could kp up with my money.ugh please tell me something or fix it!
E,Deposit Feature is Broken.
P,This app was great until it forced the flash.
N,Mailed check to bank and it was lost in mail.
N,Time for a new bank since I live two hours from Chase.
N,Developers do not care.
R,Major flaw can't deposit checks.
B,Please fix this and say so in your minor bug fixs.
N,It doesn't tell us what's fixed.
N,This app sucks on the LG g3
P,Horible!
N,Was not able to open app after update :(

E,Clean and simple but prety UI.
P,Great Ap.
E,It is very good app simple and secure
E,Frustrating Check Deposit feature.
N,The app is fine if you want to check account info and for a quick transfer of funds.
E,But the check deposit feature works 20% of the time.
E,It is very frustrating.
N,Chase Mobile Ap.
N,It painted me to use the web presence of my former bank.
N,"I searched 3 or 4 banks and as soon as I saw the Chase Ap, I knew I was home."
N,"Had to move thirty accounts,  but the time and effort were worth it."
N,Mobile Deposit.
B,Depositing a check doesn't work and gives me different errors every time.
N,Where's my balance?
N,Since the update I no longer see my account balance before loging on.
N,It works like a charm.
N,No complaints
P,hate it!
N,"when I login, it doesn't automatically take me to my account ."
N,Instead it says to call
P,Love it
N,Having issues.
N,I use this app regularly to check my account and purchases but I'm having a very serious issue with it on my new phone.
N,It's atempting to download but it won't and when I stop the download it tries to do it again.
B,It's not able to actually download and it's keeping me from geting anything else from the play store please fix this cause it's very frustrating and inconvenient.
P,Sucks.
N,"It never gives me the corect balance so every time I think that I am good, I'm in the red or my balance is lower than what it stated a few days ago."
P,"If that can be corected, this would be an awesome app."
R,There should be a just quickpay ap
B,FLASH PROBLEM - Note 4.
B,"When a user atempts to deposit a check, the camera auto turns on flash which overexposes the image (even though flash is off in camera setings)."
N,"Until this is fixed, it really is too big of a PITA to use the app."
R,It needs a way to turn on/off the flash capabilities.
B,PLEASE FIX!
B,It doesn't work with UCard.
N,It does not let me login with my UCard login information.
N,Good when I have money.
N,Bad when I don't.
P,The best.

N,This is a wasting  time and make me frustrated  i can't  log in i tried with customer service  to reset my password many times i got my bank account  locked   it didn't  work i have to wait until i get home to use my laptop .
B,even in my laptop somtimes it doing  the same problem.

B,I tryed depositing a check online and it won't connect to my camera.
N,Oh well.
P,Love It!
E,The new design is beautiful and the app is still super easy to use.
N,Thanks Chase!
E,Stupid.
N,Can only access balance?
E,This app is a step backwards.
N,No idea.
N,"Ok, on my phone its a good app no complaints."
N,"But I downloaded it on my new tablet, and when I try loging it it says they have to varify my account, cool no big deal, but when I get the code sent to my phone it keeps saying my login is wrong."
N,"I repeated it and got new codes about 10 times and it kept saying my login was wrong, but I can log in on my phone."
N,"So I deleted the app from my tablet, but still use on my phone."
P,It is not bad.
P,Good ap
P,Love this app.
N,It's a dream come true for keeping track of my finances.
N,Chase.
N,Element with this app.
E,Redesign is nice but.
N,"This app has come a long way,  but when compared with other banking aps like Bank of America or Wells Fargo,  they are behind."
R,"Cmon Chase, no check view?"
R,"I should be able to view check images that have been deposited, not hsving this is frustrating."
E,Mobile deposits are nearly impossible without perfect lighting.
R,Corect these items and I'll provide a higher rating.
E,Well secure.
E,Like that app runs smooth all the time.
R,Can't edit payee info.
N,My doctor gives me a new account number to pay every time I visit so when I had regular visits I have to manually enter my doctor every couple weeks instead of just modifying the account number.
N,Plus a handful of other annoying bugs.
P,Great.
N,"Use it daily, makes keeping track of my accounts a breeze"
P,Great app.
E,It is very convenient
B,Check Deposit does not work on HTC One M8!
E,"Initially you can see the check and take the picture, but after you take the picture, the photo is a solid green square."
N,There is just one issue.
N,I recently bought a new HTC Desire with Android 4.4 and this app will not take pictures of the check when depositing a check.
E,The camera buton turns white when pressed but nothing else hapens.
N,Please advise.
P,Prety good.
E,I like the convenience.
B,Can't open it.
P,Great.
E,Got better after update everything works and its a really helpful app.
R,Nfc suport please
P,Love it
R,Aplication is great however when a check is cleared I would like to be able to view my check on my mobile device otherwise great aplication
N,Can't deposit.
E,Worst version ever!
E,Chase Ap is easy.
N,"Been with them for a long time, and the app just ads to the convenience."
N,It works but.
N,The app works fine for me except for one thing.
B,"When taking a photo of my check, the app sometimes decides to turn the flash on."
E,That results in a picture that is completely white.
N,"You can't see the check, the counter it's laying on, nothing."
R,There needs to be a way to disable the flash(like in the standard camera ap) so the picture turns out right every time.
N,Fantastically done
N,It is ok to keep up with info I just wish that info was up to date showing purchases so you won't go over acct.
N,Can't deposit check.
N,I can not deposit a check.
N,It will not focus and fit into the box you have created!
E,It is very frustrating
N,Chase Credit cards.
N,Ap
P,Great.
N,when it works.
N,"Great when it works, unfortunately the deposit check feature, the only one worth having on your phone for, only works about 1/4 of the time."
N,"Like right now, late on a Sunday, it fails."
N,It is not exactly high traffic time
N,"Ever since the latest update, i have been unable to deposit checks."
N,"I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, using wi-fi, nothing works."
B,Please fix!
N,Deposit not working!
E,Disapointed the check deposit feature isn't working.
N,Tried all weekend with no success.
B,Please fix this or open a branch near me.
N,"March 6-9, '15 - QuickDeposit doesn't work."
B,"Tried all weekend to use QuickDeposit and it just throws an error message of "" can not connect to Chase."""
B,Please fix!
P,Awesome.
N,It works great on my Nexus 7!
N,Can't deposit check.
N,Never had a problem with the app till now!
N,"So far I've been hapy, but I keep geting a ""cannot connect to chase services at this time"" error when atempting to do an online deposit."
N,Hoping you guys fix it soon!
N,It doesn't deposit.
N,It doesn't deposit on lg g3 lollipop
B,Can't deposit checks.
B,"Updated OS to Lollipop and it says ""cannot connect to Chase"" after taking pictures and sending account info"
B,Won't let me deposit checks anymore.
B,"Every time I atempt to use the QuickDeposit feature, an error message pops up saying cannot connect to Chase."
N,Used to work great--what hapened?
N,Until the latest upgrade I never had any problems with this app.
N,"Now I can't make deposits, which is the main reason for having it."
N,"Nothing from the developer but a note about ""temporarily experiencing difficulties."""
N,How about a fix?
N,Mobile Deposit.
N,Whenever I tried to deposit a check using the picture taking method it said it wasn't connected to chase.
E,The mobile deposit is prety much the only thing I use it for.
N,Can't deposit checks.
E,This app is basically useless now.
E,"It used to be really helpful, but right now it's forcing me to waste gas and go to the bank."
N,why?
E,Useless for depositing checks.
N,It never lets you deposit a check.
N,"Reach try yields the vague error ""Temporarily unable to connect with Chase."""
N,Save yourself time and just visit the website in your browser instead.
N,Deposit broken.
N,Check deposit broken with latest update.
N,Can't deposit checks
N,Can't take photo of checks!
E,The camera isn't oriented corectly.
E,It squishes and offsets the image.
E,It's totally unusable!
N,So disapointing since previous versions worked fine.
N,POS.
N,I have not been able to log into my account even 1 time!
N,I've had to call to have my password reset 3 times then it works once and goes back to not working.
B,HORRIBLE APP FIX THIS CRAP YOU ARE A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR HOLDING BANK.
N,I HAVE APPS MADE BY TEENAGERS THAT WORK BETTER THAN THIS.
E,Moderate Security Risk.
N,According to Belac Security Advisor this app has a moderate security risk.
N,Only app of 400 I have installed that shows a risk.
N,A banking app should not have  security vulnerabilities!
N,"UPDATE - NOT SUPRIZINGLY, GIVEN THEIR LAX SECURITY WITH THIS APP, LOOKS LIKE JPMORGAN CHASE HAS BEEN HACKED BIG TIME AT A VERY DEEP LEVEL."
N,UPDATE: latest update still allows man in the midle atacks and now is the only app I have of 468 with a security risk.
N,Really!
N,And a banking ap
P,Super Garbage.
N,I tried reinstalling 5 months later and after suposed bug fixes still garbage If i could give this app zero stars i would.
N,Could not make mobile deposit kept glitching and booting me.
N,Though it might be just a bad connection but that wasn't the case.
N,I tried re downloading it and that didn't help either.please fix or I'm going to bank of america.
B,"Check deposit feature needs work, bugy."
E,Check deposit feature does not work reliably.
E,"The camera is very finicky about when it takes a picture, and several times per month, after you have spent (sometimes considerable amounts of) time photographing a check, it pops up a message ""unable to contact chase""at the curent time."
N,Can't deposit checks and can't take screenshots for my records.
N,Strongly considering changing to a different bank.
P,It work great!
P,Best banking app out there!
N,Can't deposit checks.
E,I loved the chase app but lately I haven't been able to deposit any checks via the app.
N,A message comes up saying I can't connect to chase.

N,I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 and it's up to date as well as the chase app.
P,Good!
P,Good excellent bank ap!
N,I can take contaral and track of my account love chase bank!
N,Can't Deposit Checks!
E,The bigest selling pt of this app is the Quick Deposit feature which rarely works.
N,"So, whats the point?"
N,"Aparently,  when they are doing acct maintenance you can't use Quick Deposit and get the message ""we are temporarily unable to connect."""
N,i just wasted  an hour screwing around with online banking only 2 be told its not my acct but a prblm they are having.
N,"So, why not show that message?"
E,that they are doing acct maintenence and the svc is down.
E,It is very Frustrating!
N,It does what I need it too
P,Great ap!
N,"Called bank and ham my new number aded to the text alerts, glad I did that because I can get alerts on both business and personal phone."
P,Great time saver.
P,Great app.
N,makes banking easy
R,Would be nice if I could deposit checks.most times it doesn't work
N,Can't deposit checks.
E,Last update broke the ability to deposit checks.

N,Could care less about the app if the #1 reason to have it is gone.
B,Please fix deposit bug.
N,Chase app cannot connect to Chase to deposit a check.
B,Been bugy the last few days.
N,Can't deposit checks.
N,"Sadly it's one of the most important features of the app in my opinion, and now it doesn't seem to work anymore."
N,Chase app.
N,This app is a must have.
N,"Don's know how I would stay on budget, and check each transaction for accuracy."
P,Chase is the best!
N,What hapened?
N,I've sudenly lost the ability to quick deposit.
N,This is absolutely essential to me!
N,The app won't connect to the server anymore which makes it uterly useless to me.
E,Depositing checks is impossible.
N,I'm standing there holding my breath like a sniper trying to take a shot to keep my phone still enough for it to take a picture of the check but it doesn't do anything.
N,Who is the jackass that thought this would be a helpful feature ?
N,Hit and miss.
E,"Quick deposit isn't so quick when repeated atempts need to be made and an error message shows up asking you to try again later,  and thanks you for your patience."
N,My patience is wearing out!
N,Cannot deposit checks.
E,The new update will not allow for check deposits.
N,This was main use for the mobile app.
N,Home.
N,Book1 2015
P,Great app.
P,"I have to say, this is a great app."
E,"I use a few other aps from different financial institutions and this is by far the best looking, and most functional."
E,The quick account seting is wonderful and very useful.
N,I have no qualms with this app and highly sugest geting it if you have a Chase account
N,Chase J.P. Morgan.
N,"The classic original old symbol unreal, I I grew up to that symbol."
N,I been customer for years.
R,"Did a lot of passing by watching that symbol and wishing to have an account, with you guys."
N,Samuel P. Chase on the ten thousand.dollor bill.
N,I wish i had one.
N,Permissions.
N,Why does the chase app require permissions to your contacts?
N,To spam your contacts?
N,Do you test your ap?
N,It doesn't even open after latest update.
N,I can't deposit  my  checks
N,"""CHASE BANK MOBILE  IS ONE IN MY  BOOK."
N,CHASE MOBILE.
N,IS WORKING INTO E-COMMERCE  SUCCESS.
P,Love my chase card ap!
N,This thing had saved my a $$ a good bit!
N,Q F C. Food
E,It is easy access.
E,Simple to use.
E,It is easy to access.
E,"Beautiful ap, it saves me more time, i deposit most of my checks pay bills, transfer money with this app."
P,I really love it
N,Chase mobile.
P,Love it.
E,very fast and easy.
N,This app sucks.
B,It's saying it's installed but doesn't show up in my aps.
N,Will probably close my account if I'm not able to monitor it.
N,Chase finally tops.
E,Newest version worked out the annoying  kinks.
E,"Great app work slick UI, smooth function."
N,Worst camera.
E,"Worst camera so blury and never registers as steady, to sensitive."
B,Fix please.
N,Chase.
E,It is very nice and secure
E,Practical.
P,I love it.
N,Okay.
E,"More strict than bank of america, I rather stick to them"
R,I wish the check deposit  would work.
B,Two different  phones both freezes  when you take pictures
P,So far so good.
N,"It's been over 8 months since I started using this app on my new phone, and as of now not a single hitch."
E,"The preview option is genius and saves me time from having to sign in, it's so useful I wonder why other banks haven't used it before."
E,"Another amazing feature is the chase quick pay, that's an extremely useful feature but it's unfortunate it's limited to just Chase users"
P,Love this app.
N,Makes managing my banking on the go super easy.
N,"Can easily check balances, deposit checks, and transfer money."
N,Couldn't ask for much more.
P,Great app.
E,I love the new slide for Balance feature
N,Screen shot issue.
R,Screen shot need to be fixed soonest.
N,This helps in bookeeping.
R,No CURRENT Balance Available.
N,With most banks after having made an actual transaction with your debit card you'd receive a CURRENT account balance immediately if you had your account setup for text message alerts prior.
N,Well this is not the case with Chase.
N,Why?
N,Imagine if you do everything with your debit card like i do.
N,Imagine how many times you'd mistakenly overdraft your account because you were not IMMEDIATELY aware of your CURRENT balance.
N,Why can't Chase make your curent balance available immediately after a transaction?
E,Easy.
N,No problem  navigating
N,Windows phone!
N,Bring it back to windows phone so I don't have to use my work phone to deposit checks.
N,Stop leting down your customers.
E,Useless.
E,Ap is fairly  useless.
B,Check deposit doesn't work.
N,Can use website to check balances.

P,I love this online banking so far.
N,I'm able to du a lot wit it.
P,Love chase.
P,I love this bank to death
N,Blur rear photo.
N,"This used to be a good app but now, with the update, is very hard to take the back photo of the checks."
N,"Actually, I just spent almost 10 minutes trying to take a focused rear photo to deposit a check right now."
B,Keeps crashing.
B,This app keeps crashing on my gallexy s5.
N,Never had this problem in the past.
N,Please look into it.
E,issues are so frequent it is no longer functional.
P,Prety good.
R,I wish I got a picture in my background though haha.
P,I love it!
R,"The only thing that would make it better would be if it showed pending charges, also sometimes I am looking at my bank information and I leave the app to use the calculator or another app coming back with in just a few seconds and I'm loged out."
R,I wish it let me stay loged in for a minute or two before loging me out
N,My Ultimatum to Chase!
N,"If I can't access my credit card account from your app one more time, then I'm done with you people."
N,"There are literally 100 other cards I could have besides yours, ones with convenient aps that actually let you log in and better incentives."
N,Fischer Price is more tech savy then you people.
B,Start acting like your a name everyone's heard of and fix  your sory software.
N,A+.
N,On the MONEY lol
P,Good app.
P,"Best , mobile app  for banking"
B,Fix the Check Deposit.
N,"Ap will not take pictures of checks when shuter buton is pressed, instead it waits until the camera is 'held steady' which takes about 2 minutes per picture"
N,Morons on parade.
N,"I love the ap, makes my banking life easier than ever before and there isn't a major issue unless you are one yourself which is what it comes down to for anyone having problems with it in general."
N,"The major issue is the funds in my account, Chase has failed to give me 100 dollars for free since I'm a human being, MAJOR FLAW as far as I'm concerned!"
N,"1 star for no free money, 10 for in person service at any location and 11 stars for the app."
N,I'm so upset!
P,"Love this ap, has made my life much easier."
P,Great app.
E,It is very helpful and always on point.
N,This app needs HELP!
E,I would give it more stars but the depositing check part sucks!
N,When you try and take pictures of the check it freezes up and then stops.
N,Then it won't let you get out of it until it wants to or you close the whole app.
B,FAIL.
N,I'm really hapy with this ap
P,Good app and everything works great.
N,Swipe the app and see all account balances without signing in
N,deposit?
R,Could not use to deposit state refund check.
N,Annoying!
N,Camera Issues.
N,I've used this app before and curently have it on two devices.
E,"However, the camera function never works for me with this device."
N,"If i can't make use of all the functions, it's no good to me."
N,UNINSTALLING
E,Deposits do not work!
N,Can not get the deposits to go through!
N,Tells me to go to the bank to make a deposit!
N,WTH!
N,Checks.
N,Can you set it up where i can enter the checks that i write so i can track them until the check clears.
R,I would like to be able to enter the amount and the check number and to whom i wrote the check.
N,Thanks
R,It needs Improvement.
N,I have two galaxy s5.
E,In other words the same exact phone and the app functions differently on both.
N,Mainly the notifications.
N,On one phone I can actually go in there touch on them and read the details on the other I can only see the main screen.
B,Please Fix.
E,Beautiful and does the job
N,"SUCKS, 4.3 really, how?"
N,The only thing the app is good for is to check your account.
N,"Can't wire money, transfer money,  heck it won't even show you your whole acct."
N,Number.
N,Pathetic.
N,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!
R,Please ad a pin to login like Discover.
P,Good.
E,Slow litle but overall okay
P,Best Bank Ap Ever.
N,Update 01/01/15 No serious changes.
E,Some changes in features with a much nicer layout with scenes.
N,"I will give it six stars when I can take a picture of my cash and it gets deposited, ha ha."
N,"Chase did great with the new update, congrats."
E,I love the new look!
N,Check deposit is still broken.

N,Suits my needs!
R,Can't deposit.
B,Please fix.
R,Can't deposit my checks.
N,It logs off after taking the picture of the back of the check.
R,Can't deposit Checks.
N,"Use  to work fine, but now I'm  finding it impossible to use the deposit check feature on my new Samsung note 4."
N,I select my account then put in the amount.
N,When I hit next to take the check pictures nothing hapens.
B,The app just freezes on the account selection screen.
N,I never had a problem with this app on my iphone.
N,Sadly I'm seeing more and more issues with android based aps.
N,On the go bank access.
E,Ease of use and functional above all.
N,Yeah.
N,Oh boy
B,It does not work.
N,"Sends you a code to authorize device, then tells you it can't display account information."
E,"Hey Chase, your app is USELESS."
N,Are you working with Google?
P,Great app.
E,Love this app it's so convenient!
N,Wrong amounts?
N,Really?
N,It seems like this app will work great for a a few weeks until its stops calculating your available balance and you end up over spending.
N,First time this has ever hapened and I'm an extremely unhapy about it.
N,This.
N,It needs.
N,To.
N,Be.
N,Fixed.
P,Good ap
N,Review and Sugestions.
E,"I like the aparently, it's very easy to use."
R,"However, I wish you could set up more than one alert seting for your account."
R,An example would be to have one alert go off if your account is under $100 and another if it went under $12.
N,It does everything i need.
P,Love it
N,Update convenience problem.
N,"Updated chase mobile on my tablet and now it will not connect to my camera so I can make use of mobile deposit convenience, which is the whole reason I downloaded this app."
N,An app that asks for way more information and permission than it needs to function
P,Great app.
E,Love how easy it is to see all my accounts.
N,I have not used the check deposit feature in awhile but when I have it has always worked for me.
N,Keep it up Chase
N,Thanks  Ap
P,I hate it!
E,"But not because the app sucks the app is actually prety good and works well but I hate it because it gives my mom and dad a reason not to buy me stuff, it really makes me angry"
N,very nice app.
P,Great ap
E,Blocked screenshot.
N,"I use screenshot for my mobile transactions but since you've blocked it, you just made one costumer of yours unhapy."
E,UI/UX design on login page.
N,Why is the slide out keyboard hiding the login fields and the user cannot swipe up and down?
N,Clearly no UAT was done!
N,Chase mobile.
P,Great
B,deposit stoped working.
N,my main reason to use this app is to deposit checks.
R,"after recent uodate the deposit feature stoped working, app always takes crapy images of the check and crashes from time to time."
N,Chase mobile
E,Prety good and eminently useful.
E,SCREEN SHOT CAPABILITY GONE.
N,I shouldn't have to hand my employer my bank account info for him to thumb through.
N,Nor should I have to run to the BANK to grab a print out.
N,It's why I have the app.
R,I should be able to just SS my deposits and show my employer that I've been shorted.
R,Will give more stars when the feature is returned.
N,Is it chase or the ap?
N,I can log in but can not see any of my account balances.
N,Is it chase or is it the ap?
N,On the GO!
P,One of the best financial aps.
N,It works fine for me.
N,When I do deposit via app it works

R,It just needs to be moved up an inch or 2!
N,Wow.
P,Cool ap
P,Perfect.
N,It works good.
N,Never had a problem.
P,Love it.
N,IF YOU WANT TO DEPOSIT CHECKS.

B,Eror.
B,Keep geting error message when trying to access camera trying to make deposit!

N,Implement PIN login.
P,It's a good app.
N,But it's really painful to type the password every time.
R,"Please, implement the PIN login."
R,Can't deposit checks.
N,I liked this app until it stoped leting me deposit my checks.
N,Bill pay.
B,Can't connect?
R,Can't pay bill.
B,Let's fix this shall we.
E,Best site easy to use and I'm able to manage my account a whole lot better.
B,Check Depositing Shody with Constant Freezes.
E,"While the majority of the app functions relatively fluidly, the function of check deposits is almost unusable."
B,"It can take me upwards of 20 minutes to get a successful deposit atempt between the camera freezing and not taking pictures, to its inability to converse with the servers forcing me to restart the process."
N,"On other devices, the app will not even integrate with the camera."
N,"While a fantastic idea, it amazes me that years after its debut it will still not function."
N,"I cannot figure out how to show savings account,"
N,No more preview?
N,Why can't we swipe to the left to preview without loging in anymore?
P,Best app ever.
N,The must technological bank in the world.
N,It works 1/2 time.
B,"Most of the time it is ""temporarily unavailable."""
P,Love it.
N,Makes my banking so much easier
N,Chase.
P,I love it
E,Innovative.
N,Chase knows how to keep up with the times.

N,"Can.t get it to open, after updating."
E,So easy!
E,I love the quick preview to check your balances without having to log on!
N,NeysaJ.
N,"Again, I would rate it a 5; however, I am not able to update any of my aps."
N,"Also, I have deleted a ton of emails."
N,even though I have more than enough memory.
B,I keep geting a message that says I don't have sufficient space.
N,I have deleted most of my aps.
N,"But, I continue to get the same message, it says that I don't have sufficient memory."
P,Best in class.
E,Can do so many things on the go I love it very convenient
E,Much better
N,New.
E,It is very convince
E,Useless.
N,Chase stoped suport for its app for my windows phone so I had to download the app on my tablet.
N,"I needed this app for one thing and one thing only, mobile deposits."
N,This app can not connect to my tablets camera rendering the app useless.
N,"Nice way to find out your info etc,,"
E,I like the new preview option so much more convenient
P,Great Progess.
N,UX finally takes a focus.
R,But one big missing thing: android notifications for secure messages.
N,(Who still uses email?)
N,wow it updated and then stoped notifying me when I went over what was on my card then charged me fees.
B,but for real FIX THE NOTIFICATION!
B,It does not work.
N,It says my password or username is wrong.
N,when I type it on the computer it works but when I use this app it does not
P,Da best
P,It good I like it.
N,Chase ?CORPORATE NAZIS? ?DISABLE SCREENSHOT!
N,Chase ?CORPORATE NAZIS? ?DISABLE SCREENSHOT!
N,"yes, if you ever doubted Chase Bank's corporate America NAZI behavior, you need only look as far as their DELIBERATE DISABLING OF SCREENSHOTS ""for security reasons"" in their 2015 JAN/FEB app updates."
N,"With this, Chase has forced me to use my smartphone to snap a photo of the ap's screen on my tablet ."
N,"thanks, Chase, for NOT RESOLVING LONG-EXISTING PROBLEMS with your ap, and instead, ?DELIBERATELY CREATING NEW DIFFICULTIES FOR YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS?"
N,I have never had a problem with the app.
N,It works great does everything I need!
R,Great hut could be better.
N,I love the app but really like a way to setup recuring payments from my mobile device so i don't have to find a computer

N,MANIGE MONEY.
P,Good wark
N,I like the other app better that I had.
P,It is very good app but could improve.
E,Really like that i can manage the rewards from the app.
B,Check deposit didn't work when i tried it.
R,I wish for a login method other than entering the password for online banking.
P,Something like swipe
P,So bad!
P,"The app is so bad, doest have the options to notify you when you get pay."
E,etc plus the customer services at bank is so bad.
N,I don't recomand it to anyone.
P,Great.
P,It's perfect.
B,Can't close with back buton.
B,Chase app always stays open unless you force close it.
B,Can't close by pressing back buton.
E,Big security risk.
B,Please fix!
P,Perfect Ap.
N,Thanks chase bank.
B,It doesn't work.
P,This app is garbage.
E,The quick deposit feature doesn't work.
R,This would be a very convenient app if it ever worked.
N,"Try after try, I still can't make a deposit."
N,I snap multiple photos and atempt many times to make remote deposits.
B,It hardly works.
N,Disapointing.
N,Tech suport from Chase on this issue is no help.
N,Basically you get no answers about the issue.
N,"They just say that your phone camera is not compatible, no mater which phone you use."
B,They show no interest in fixing the issue.
N,Disapointing.
N,What hapened?
N,I have been using the chase mobile app with 100% success for over a year.
N,I work at home and do not have the option of running to the bank to make daily deposits.
N,"All of a suden, it takes more than 2 minutes to deposit each check as the camera aparently moves with every beat of my heart rendering the app useless."
N,My husband went to the bank and made a deposit and came back before I was able to make to deposit with this app.
N,It is 3 miles to the bank.
E,This is ridiculous.
N,Nifty.
N,"""Device will take picture when steady"" (takes time for it to capture it once buton is pressed) sometimes indefinitely."

E,Elcamino real location was exceptionally helpful and Cynthia
P,It's awesome.
N,I have not had any issues with this app.
N,And I asked the bank if I have a problem with this app if they could help.
N,They said yes.
N,So I'm glad they can fix any booboos I might have.
R,disable flash option.
R,we need to option to turn off the flash when taking a picture of a check.
E,"it washes it out and makes the ""deposit check"" option useless."
P,"otherwise, I love the app."
E,I love the ease of access to pay ALL of my bills.
N,It still really stinks.
E,Log in is hit and miss.
E,Great for quick balance and to view direct deposits and transactions.
P,Great
P,Great app but.

N,How to the fix the Deposit issue.
N,Many of us have experienced issues with this aplication when depositing checks on an Android.
N,This hapens to me with other bank aps when using the camera to save the check's image.
N,"After some tinkering, I confirmed the issue has to do with the lack of light; the phone is unable to read the text and process the image."
N,Solution: make sure you have the Flash activated and bring the lights down in your room.
N,"When you take the picture in a dark room, the Flash will activate and get a better image."
N,This tool now works 100% of the time for me.
N,I hope this helps you.

N,Well.
E,The bigest reaspn to get the app is the deposit feature.
R,No idea why a perfectly decent picture is rejected by the app.
N,"Used to work well, now it seems that you have to take three or four pictures before it accepts the check."
N,Glitchy to say the least.

N,"It's okay, can't access quickpay."
