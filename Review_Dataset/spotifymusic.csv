N,Def worth my 4.99 monthly fee.
P,great.
P,amazing
R,Needs a new filter.
B,I love Spotify but one thing that bugs me is that there's no option to filter out explicit songs.
N,I personally don't have a problem with explicit songs but I would like to be able to play my music on speakers without leting any easily-impressible people hearing.
P,They have just about everything great ap
N,Optimus f7
P,Excellent aplication

P,Love it
P,It's Marvelous.
N,"I love this ap,  I have the premium version  I am having problems for over a week my songs don't advance and I've done everything that I was told.it has to be the app because it's hapening on more than one device.I have been using it for over a year and all of a suden these problems arise."

N,I need help.
B,"It's either my old tablet or the app but everytime I click the logo, the app just goes black or force closes."
E,Everyone and phones are different.
N,You just have to try it out for your self everyone is different in there own way but I love it's grate for going on a run with my phone.
P,It's good but not great.
N,I hate when things say they're free and then don't let you use the most basic functions of the app like what music you want to play.
N,I would make it so you could actually use all of the aps functions.
E,It downloads slow but worth it.
P,It's great love it.
N,But when you look up  a song and try to ad it to my playlist it doesn't go on or it doesn't play.
N,But its really great you should download it?
N,"What I want, when I want!"
E,It's just that simple.

N,Spotify.
P,Awesome.
N,Has everything you can think of.
N,Mobile purchase.
R,I would give 5 stars if I had the ability to pay through phone instead of card.
N,Because there are people (like myself) without access to a credit card so I make purchases through my phone.
R,So I'd be very grateful if I'd be able to obtain that ability for spotify premium perchase.
N,Mr.Wonferful.
N,I am so thankful for being a part of the group.Thank you all!
P,Love it
P,Love it!
N,Spotify Music.
N,Beats all other music aps.
P,Good but.
N,It annoys me that when I want to listen to a specific album you ad songs from other albums just because they're the same artist.
N,I wanted to listen to Peter Paul and Mary's greatest hits and the next thing I know it's playing stuff from their Christmas album .
B,please fix!

P,Best in class.
N,"Sory Play music, Pandora and others but Spotify is just beter."
E,The app is more beautiful and the service itself is beter.
E,"More lists to choose from depending your mood, more public playlists etc."
N,"Others don't even have these features, and premium subscription is definitely a keep!"
P,BEST!
P,This is the best
B,Keeps freezing.
N,On my old phone it used to work perfect.
B,With my new phone it keeps freezing and shuting down.

N,I think $10 for premium  is a very high price when I could just use YouTube for any music.
N,I droped my premium  account and will never go back .
N,I'm staying as a free account.
N,Spotify needs to catch up with the game.
N,$5 a month I would pay but  not $10 when I can listen to our for free

N,Plus it's a riot at parties!
P,60s  70s music great
N,Downloadable.
N,There's music I have in my comp library that I would love to ad to my mobile account.
N,Spotify used to do this.
N,But for whatever reason.
B,The songs I have aded from my library won't sync to my account.

P,Great ap
P,I Love this app very much.
P,I love it
E,So much beter than Pandora!
N,One of the best aspects about this app is that as soon as you hear a song that you like you can save it right away!
N,Pandora doesn't offer that.
N,And you don't have to deal with a limit for skiping songs.
N,You are more in control.
N,It only gets four stars from me because it doesn't recognize my audio video receiver since the most recent update.
N,"That means I can't stream music from my phone to my audio video device via Bluetooth, WiFi, or cellular."
N,Works just fine!
P,Good ap
E,Terible.
B,"Crashes constantly, sometimes won't even open  take 5 minutes to load a 3 minute song"
P,All good.
E,All good especially for streaming high quality music.
B,Litle issue with the shuffle play: sometimes when I skip song it repeats the curent song then restarts the entire shuffle.
N,I'm paying for premium so it's not an issue with ads or anything.
N,And most of my songs are downloaded.
P,"Love it, but."
B,I really love Spotify and I've had no problems on my computer but recently the mobile app on my phone will randomly stop playing music and won't respond for a couple of minutes.
B,I'd love to give this a 5 star again but not until that's fixed.
N,I even uninstalled and reinstalled it to no avail.

E,Great selection of songs.
P,Best ap
N,Wonderful experience listening to my great music with great artist which I enjoy listening to.
P,Love it
N,Eh.
N,"Whenever I use the app and use another app at the same time, it stops like the song stops playing and I have to back every time."
N,It won't let me use Kik or any other all while I'm using Spotify.
N,Would give 5 stars if fixed thank you and oh by the way I use LG Optimus L70
P,Awesome
N,Spotify Music.
P,Excellent ap!
E,Great quality and wide selection of music!
P,Awesome
R,Like it although it would be great if it would stop repeating the same songs over and over on the shuffle play.
N,Nice.
R,It's fantastic but please lower the premium bill its despicable.
P,Great app.
N,I really liked the free version so I had to buy premium because it was geting annoying not being able  to listen the song I wanted.
N,Also I recommend a preview of the songs for the free version.
N,Overall great app if you don't want to be downloading music and taking up so much space on your phone!
P,Great
P,Love!
P,Really enjoying
N,New to Spotify.
P,So far I love this app.
N,It keeps me updated on new gospel music.
N,Nice.
R,"So less Japanese song , Looking forward the play station music"
P,THE BEST!
P,It's the coolest aplication I've ever downloaded!
N,Thank you!
P,Great
N,The most glitchy app I own.
N,I'm stuck with using spotify because one there isn't anything else like it on the market and two I pay for it.
N,"But there has not been a day for the past 6 months that this app hasn't crashed, frozen or just won't open."
P,Spotify is amazing but this is geting old.
N,If it doesn't change I will probably take my money else where.
E,I like the new update but.
R,"Please ad option to remove the ""undownload"" buton"
P,Good ap
N,It improved.
N,It stoped deleting my music every time i restarted my phone.
R,I'd love to ad songs that spotify doesn't have to my Playlist like you can with the desktop app.
P,Other than that I love spotify!
P,The Best.
E,The best music service available.
N,Nice
N,Still trying to figure out how to download the songs to my device
P,It's perfect.
E,"With high speed Internet, this app is a simply fantastic."
P,Very good app i moved to pandora though
N,So nice
P,Great.
N,Use it everyday.
N,I wouldn't mind if there were fewer ads but it's still a fantastic ap
P,I love it
N,Spotify .
P,Amazing .
N,latest release .
N,not so much.
N,"Spotify is basically the background of my life, listen using it for about 12 hours a day."
N,I have a premium account and don't know what I would do without it.
E,HOWEVER the latest 2015 rwlease has made the app incredibly slow (galaxy s4).
N,So much so that if I manage to get a playlist started before leaving the house I know I won't be able to change the song or use the app Pl at all without rebooting the phone.
N,I get spinning circle all the time.
N,Even my my offline content!
E,It is unresponsive.
N,Who spilled coke on the controls?
N,"Someone done goofed, son."
N,"The app stoped allowing me to search for and load new artists, so I decided to uninstall and reinstall."
B,Now the app won't even open.
B,"""Spotify has stoped."""
N,Every time now.
P,"Come on, guys, I love this app."
N,I literally don't even use the integrated music app on my phone anymore because of this.
B,Please fix this.
N,Wgl wgl
P,Simply suoerb !
N,WTF.
B,I opened it when it finished downloading and if I try to sign up it goes back my home screen.
B,Fix This PLZ!
N,Simplemente spoti madafakas!
N,Sal Rosas
P,Amazing
E,"Best selection, user friendly."
N,"I have spent HOURS trying to find that perfect music downloader that actually comes thru consistantly, and i think Spotfly is what i have been looking for all along, thank you for ap!"
N,Fix this.
R,I expect a reply.
B,"Jesus Christ, developers please f8x the bug that causes the app to mention that your device has ran ou5 of storage."
N,This notification pop as I was downloading songs.
N,I still had 2 gb internal and 3 in sd card.
N,no privacy.
B,freezes a lot.
B,ok so spotify keeps changing my setings to allow it to post on my page and show my friends what I'm listening to.
N,and if I change it back to private its changed back within 30secs.
N,also if I jump on Facebook and change app privaliges spotify will ask me every 7secs to give it permission to post on my behalf until I let it.
N,WHY!
N,WHY DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO LET EVERYONE SEE .
N,WHY DO YOU NEED TO POST ON MY BEHALF.
N,I CANCELED MY SUBSCRIPTION WITH YOU
P,Amazing so far.
N,I have only had it for a few days.
P,Great!
N,My main stream of music.
N,Just got a new phone recently and I didn't have to back my songs to transfer music.
P,Amazing!
E,The best service of music!
N,I strongly recommend it.
E,So big.
N,I have had to remove all other aps on my phone so I can download the music as there is no option to backup to my SD card.
P,So frustrating!
N,Sugested song genres.
N,"I was laying in bed, trying to relax and go to sleep, listening to meditational music."
N,I was about to fall asleep when all of a suden I hear the piercing shriek of miley Cyrus' voice.
R,"The ""sugested songs"" should at least be in the same genre PLEASE!"
B,"Horible problem for me regularly, will give higher rating when this is fixed."
N,Aight.
E,Good music
N,No free trial?
N,Is it really true that there's no free trial anymore and it's free forever and not just 30 days?
R,That would be amazing.
P,excellent l love it
P,Awsome.
R,Love the app but I would love it more if there was a cast buton so when I have party's its easier to listen to music

N,Spotify.
N,Yse this daily esp when driving between apoints at work.
E,Clear be easy to use
P,Awesome BUT.
R,Would easily give 5 stars but only 3 due to the fact that we don't have the ability in the setings for edited music.
R,Sory but I would like to isten to the music I love without my 4yr old hearing every swear in the book in some of these tracks.
N,Great if you pay for premium.
N,"Can't moan really because I'm using the free version but it doesn't let me play anything a lot of the time, even in shuffle."
N,I had some problems with the app at first but it is all good now.
P,And i like it
N,Wow
N,Starting to dislike it if you don't pay for it the music will stop playing for over 2 hours not very good!
N,RDIO is beter
P,Brilliant
P,It's awesome.
E,Always works and its easy to use
N,Floyd.
N,I downloaded the app when spotify became available in the US.
E,Greatest selection of music and artist.
E,Beter than Pandora's.
R,Only problem is need to allow you to select songs you would like to play instead of being locked in Shuffle Play on android phone.
R,Need to offer more in Premium than ad free.

P,Great for music.
N,I'm even paying monthly
E,The shuffle sucks I end up hearing the same songs within the hour when I know there are more songs.
N,Also if I wanted my friends to know what I was listening to I would call them quit offering to post it to Facebook for me.
N,Also no tool that alone should give me reason to give one star
N,Nc.
N,Nice
N,Sometimes.
E,You only have limited Skips

N,Uter rubish!
N,Ok I get it.
N,"I'm using the free version (having stoped the premium version several years ago for reliability issues) so my expectations were very, very low."
N,I tried again with Spotify because I hoped they had fixed the app and it would reliably play a song all the way through from start to finish.
N,But sadly NO.
E,The app is still as unreliable and uterly useless as it has ever been.
N,The positive of this is at least I didn't sign up for the paid app again and waste even more money.
P,The closest thing to perfect.
R,This would be the perfect music app if i didn't have to upgrade to premium (pay) just to listen without wifi
P,Cool.

N,Spotify.
E,I love this app it's much beter than Pandora.
P,No buffering and freezing great app keep up the good work!

N,Do something about that you got to winner and I'm stayin' on board.
N,I can't even update this app because it's geting up too much of my onboard memory but I got plenty of memory on my SD card.
