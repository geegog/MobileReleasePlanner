R,Bring back month view!
R,No monthly view on smartphone makes it useless
R,Bring back month view.
N,Ap is nice.
E,Looks and feels smooth.
R,However a month view is a necessity!
E,"The month preview is nice, but it doesn't cut it."
R,I wish it displayed the color of the events rather than just grey.
R,Also a widget with month view would be nice.
P,Love it.
P,Awesome
N,1080p screen =/=> 5 days!
N,I switched to Today Calendar Pro!
E,The previous versions were wonderful.
E,The updated version of G.C. is backwards with way less options.
E,Cool Calendar
P,Good.
N,"Rarely any issues with it, but when I do it's easy to fix."
R,"Would like to see monthly view, and could have a better 4-day view."
E,"Other than that, it does its job and keeps me organized and syncs prety well."
E,It is not so thrilled any more.
E,It is not syncing and no monthly view?
N,"It was awesome, and it helped me get on track with work."
P,Love!
N,Month View.
R,"I'd give it a 5, but the lack of month view breaks it for me."
E,Looks better than it functions.
N,Why can't I ad an exchange calendar event from my Nexus 7?
N,"I really don't use my gmail calendar for much, and certainly not for anything work-related."
N,"If I need to ad something important to my calendar, I have to pick up my Galaxy S4."
R,Please stop trying to push us to gmail.
P,Loving it.
E,Really good I like the widget that tells me what's going to hapen today and tomorow etc well done like how there's more colors to pick
N,Widget.
R,Would like different widgets for this.
N,It only has a widget for the day.
N,Other than that it is prety good for what I need.
R,Miss the old layout.
R,I liked being able to look at the month view and have some indication what part of the day my apointments were.
E,These circles are no help.
N,Functionally has gone to the wayside in favour of aesthetics.
N,Guys the new update works for lolipop.
N,I am a moto g 1 gen user and so far the lollipop doing great and the google calendar works great in lollipop guys upgrade your  system ASAP
P,Great ap
N,What hapened?
N,"I used to be able to edit single events in a series, but now I have to either change all of them or all future ones."
R,Also no month view and a generally worse experience than the previous version.
E,It is very disapointed in what this app has become.
N,Nice.
P,GOOGLE IS DOING A Great job
N,Greg Otersbach.
B,Stoped working.
B,Events disapear and won't save.
N,I can't use it now and I need a working calendar on my phone.
P,Was good one.
N,With latest updates I am forced to search alternative.
R,Main reason is lacking of month view.
N,The game done changed
E,Looks nice but that's it.
E,It is very prety but completely useless.
R,"No month view, not even a full week view."
E,Pointless graphics take up space.
N,I didn't believe a Google product could be as bad as the reviews said but it really is.
N,Don't bother.
E,Bad update.
R,Calendar can't zoom out far enough to view the entire week on my phone anymore.
E,It's incredible inconvenient to schedule things when you have to scroll up and down to find an empty time slot in the week(s)!
N,Google calendar.
N,Stuffed up by update on Dec 14
N,Sync issue.
N,It's not properly syncing with my corporate account.
B,Often my data is lost.
N,It was good with KitKat OS.
N,The issue started only after upgrading to Lollipop OS.
N,The same case with the default mail client.
N,Lag!
N,A lot of lag!
N,"Ok, but."
N,"I am a month viewer, what should I do?"
N,How can I get the circles widget on my phone?
N,I can only see the day tasks widget.
P,Excellent and Nice Ap.
N,Instagram: xboy55555
E,Update is terible!
R,Cannot delete all instances of a recuring event.
N,Only curent and future instances can be deleted keeping past events inside the calendar.
E,The space is zoomed in too much which means we need to scroll up and down to see regions which were visible at a glance in the old calendar.
E,Scrolling is terible and not smooth.
E,"Creating new events, ading notifications, takes longer because of bad interface design  Worst of all, ading or deleting events produces no visible changes unless calendar is restarted!"
N,This hapens 30% of the time.
E,Google's emphasis seems to be on fancy integration of calendar with other aspects of my life like email and in the process they have ruined a perfectly good calendar.
N,Spare a thought for users who wish to keep their calendars small and tidy and functional.
N,Terible.
E,Absolutely useless.
R,Missing views.
R,Lack of month view is big issue.
R,No way seeing week numbers anymore.
N,"Uses to have good widgets, now it is really hard to manage time with this."
R,Missing useful features.
E,"Disapointed with the recent update; No month view, no 7-day view, no option to set event visibility (private/public), no option to show available/busy."
E,It was more useful before Lollipop.
R,It needs a monthly widget.
N,It doesn't allow changes or delete duplicate entries.
N,Incorporates duplicates from yahoo but you can't delete one.
N,Same thing with contacts.
R,No option to set for month at a glance.
E,Useless to me.
N,Lacking.
N,"I don't know why Google wants to have so few features to theur aps, but this one for sure needs more."
R,Month view and sharing options for calendars would be obvious.
E,The old version was better.
E,Interface looks tacky and there is no month view.
E,Looks clutered.
E,Hard to navigate around.
N,It is very disapointing.
N,I  think I will go back to the old fashion way of using a paper diary and pencil.
N,Google take note.
E,"Your design team is out of touch with reality, simplicity is the key as the previous version was."
N,No need for all this crap they have produced.
B,Fix bugs please.
N,With latest update I'm not able to save a recuring entry.
N,It won't even save it once if I've turned on recuring.
E,And the way it auto ads reminders is crap too.
N,Birthdays issue.
B,I'm not able to see birthdays even though I've synced it!
R,No month view.
N,Who's great idea was this?
E,"The tablet version is brilliant, not so for the phone."
N,Staying with aCalendar.
E,Difficult to change between views.
E,Difficult to switch months.
E,"Maybe there shortcuts, but it wasn't intuitive enough for me to figure out."
E,"Still, it's a beautiful app worth reconsidering in the future."
N,Google calendar.
R,"Too much for over function,  give me the seven day view back in portrait"
P,It is not bad
E,Terible View Options.
R,I hate that you can't see a week view unless twisting your phone.
R,There is no option for changing the size to see an entire day on the screen.
R,I want the old calendar back.
N,It is not hapy with app.
R,No custom or monthly view - unacceptable.
R,No available symbols.
R,Where are the instructions on the use of new features?
E,From where did the cute graphic for my nail apointment come?
N,How do I do that again?
R,Where are the tasks?
E,The event entry page is awkward.
N,I know there's more but basically - I don't like it!
N,The only benefit now is that it is synced with my laptop.
B,WOULD NOT WORK!
E,Month view is useless.
R,I cannot see any colored events in the month view unlike any other device.
N,This dives me nuts!
E,Good calendar and nice look.
R,"Would give it 5 stars if it had a better widget - the curent view with vertical scrolling feels too ""zoomed in"" on today, you don't get a good overview of your week."
P,Like it but.
R,I wish you would list the key words to get the graphics to apear.
P,Really like that.
R,Also bring back the hours choice in notification.
N,Now only days and weeks.
N,Crazy.
N,Other than that.
N,View.
N,I view my schedule in a monthly manner.
E,Without the view it is not as effective for me.
N,Going back to the calendar my Samsung came with; will use Google's of it begins offering that option.
R,No month view.
R,Geting rid of the month view was not an improvement.
N,Lag.
N,It's lag when scrolled it down.
B,I'm on M7 4.4.3 please fixed it.
N,I knew that you guys could do that.
E,Update sucks!
N,Can't believe they took away the month view!
P,I used to love this app.
E,Another horible job.
N,Seriously what're you guys doing?
E,Maps hasn't worked corectly in MONTHS and now ya go and totally bollocks up my calendar.
R,Just put it back already sheesh.
P,Love it
P,It is not good.
N,I originally liked this until somehow ALL of my apointments were deleted and now they won't save when I re-enter them.
E,I deleted the app since it's useless.
N,Feature-less.
E,"This latest update removed the most useful feature, that is, viewing an overview of the month with aproximately placed events."
E,The whole circled days thing is useless by comparison.
N,"Why would they make something less helpful and think it's a better ""feature?"""
E,"Also, the old layout fit better on my phone screen size and all the extra scrolling from the ""prety"" pading is annoying comparatively."
R,"Can I please have the old compact, more informative version back?"
E,Too Smart For It's Own Good.
N,"Google Calendar is, by far, my most used Google app."
E,The latest updates have made it almost impossible to use.
E,"The lack of pinch-to-zoom, the excessive amount of screen space minor UI items take up, and the lack of a week-view in portrait mode are all obnoxious."
E,"But the worst part, by far, is the absolute lack of any setings what-so-ever."
R,It would be amazing to disable the automatic adjustment to event times.
N,"If I change the start time to an hour earlier, I don't necessarily want the end time changed, too."
N,Terible.
N,"It's a joke, extremely time consuming, they make copying an event almost an impossible task."
N,It is not the best help.
N,"Still SLOWLY finding more and more this app can do, only hampered by the lack of a good search facility."
R,No longer allows choosing calendar to make apointment.
N,More disapointment from Google.
N,May have to look at iphone
N,Let me decide how to look at my data.
R,My opinion of this app would be much higher if Google would give me more control over customizing my views.
E,I hate having to go through multiple clicks when a sort would do.
R,It needs to be like the tablet version!
E,"The tablet version is amazing with the month view and the drawings at the top, I love that."
R,Bring it to the phone please!
R,Also 7 day view would be better than the 5 day that's show in portrait.
R,Bring back the monthly view!
N,"Great, other than that"
R,Icon should show which date and month actually is.
R,Birthday notification missing.
E,Terible calendar for humans.
N,Most humans need a 7 day week!
R,Please stop changing things that aren't broken GOOGLE!
N,I used to like you.
P,This looks like it's for kids!
E,Worse UI than before.
N,"Nothing about the Lollipop version is obviously better to me, but two things are ""materially"" worse ."
R,"no 7 day view and no good month view, like the previous version."
R,Please make it easier to get the old views back.
R,"I'd give it a five if there was a month view for my phone, I like it otherwise."
N,I have it on my tablet and there I have nothing to complain about.
N,Why would you ruin it?
N,Was a 5 star app till they changed the month view.
N,I figured out you can see A month view by touch the name of the month but why?
N,Then it goes away when you pull the day up then won't come back.
N,WHY DID Y'ALL DESTROY A GOOD APP?!
N,Lately I can't edit.
N,"Sadly, it seems like I can edit."
E,It is not usable anymore.
N,Seems like the same retards who've handled Maps revamp have goten their hands on the mobile calendar app.
E,Nothing is usable but a poor linear agenda view.
R,No (usable)  weekly view.
R,No monthly view (at all!)
N,"Goodbye,  and thanks for all the fish guys?€?"
N,Month view.
E,Hate new layout why is there no month view?
R,Want monthly view.
R,"Please include ""monthly view"" in the next update,  i started using another calendar because of lack of monthly view!"
N,suck!
R,can't see other people calendar!
N,Cripled.
R,It needs month view.
R,It needs 7 day view.
N,"Got rid of the ability to vertically zoom (i.e., see more than 6 hours of time on the 5-day view, or fit more events in the schedule view)"
R,Cannot import events.
N,I seem to have lost the ability to important events from .
N,ICS files.
N,I use this functionality for work so it's disapointing that it isn't working.
N,I open them from Gmail.
E,Incredibly poorly design.
E,It is very disapointed.
N,How hard is it to do something right?
B,Kul but one problem.
B,That problem is bugs in it as it lags very much so please solve this issue.
N,Thank you
P,It's really cool.
E,Nice UI and features
N,Waste to use.
N,I am just fed up wd thz app.
N,whenever i ad event it unfortunately stop.
B,please fix thz bug as soon .
B,It doesn't work well with exchange.
N,"Exchange has issues, and so does Google calendar, neither work well."
R,No month view
N,Whst hapened?
E,This is suposed to be an improvement but its just  lot of decoration and too hard to use.
R,Give me the previoud version.
E,Update ruined it.
N,The main reason I liked this was because it had a month view.
N,Now I can't even see the whole day at a glance without having to scroll and can't see more than 5 days at a time!
N,Tasks not shown.
E,Gmail tasks are not shown.
N,Events only.
P,It's good.
R,Just wish I could back up the information.
P,Fix that and its perfect.
E,Hate the new UI.
E,Do NOT like new layout.
R,I need to be able to see the entire month with each individual color-coded apointment in it.
R,Also prefered widget with clear background.
N,Will be uninstalling and searching for old apk.
R,bring back week view.
N,I won't update past 201404014 until 7 day week view is aded back
N,So Minimal That It's Virtually Unusable.
E,This is by far the least functional app that Google has developed.
R,There is no month view.
R,There are absolutely no setings to tweak.
N,"It starts in schedule view even though that's not useful at all to me, no mater how I leave it when I exit the app."
R,There is no way to set reminders/tasks.
E,"It seems like it's not optimized for high resolution screens, since most of the apointment blocks only show the first few leters of the apointment title when looking at anything other than the schedule view."
R,"Holidays don't show (yes, I went to setings to pick my country, etc)."
R,A monthly view would be also be helpful.
E,It is not too impressed so far.
E,Calender  dislike :(.
P,"Used to love this calendar, but doesn't sync now, used to be my most used app but can't use it now."
R,"Please bring back the older calendar,  it worked!"
R,I need a monthly view.
R,"Without the month view, this app renders useless for me and many of my other peers."
B,Stoped.
N,Ap keeps closing so I had to download outlook so I can use the calander
N,New update widget.
E,New update widget not working.
R,How to get the older version back.
E,"New update suck, no showing any event in the widget, terible view."
E,Hate the update.
R,I like that I was able to see a whole month at a time.
N,"Now I can see at most, 5 days."
R,It need to do better.
N,WTF?!
R,It need a month view.
N,Why my calendar on my prepaid phone has it.
N,Why not my contract phone.
N,"So I upgrade to a phone with a nice big screen, and Google immediately change their calendar app so I can only view 5 days at a time?"
N,Pathetic
N,Yikes.
E,Ugly.
N,Clunky.
N,Zero setings.
P,Just awful
B,Won't sync anymore.
N,Since the update.
N,So this app for prety much useless for me now.
N,On the other hand I don't need to complain about the other changes now.
N,Downgraded.
N,No more events from Gmail.
N,"Previously, events were pulled from Gmail."
E,It is not perfect
N,Agenda view.
R,Bring back agenda view with month above.
N,Drop down month that auto collapses as soon as you scroll agenda (called schedule in your ap) is infuriating.
N,Google Calendar app Rocks!
P,Excellent app.
E,It is easy to use and ad events!
N,Installed on my Samsung galaxy S4.
N,I am impressed.
P,Great.
E,"Love it in Agenda mode, can share with wife so can coordinate events."
R,Hopeless for kids birthdays that don't have a coresponding contact
N,Refined to brilliance.
E,The latest update is really cool.
N,"I have one gripe though; my anniversary is not a ""Birthday""."
R,It needs full month view.
R,"A calendar app needs a proper way to view the whole month, including at least partial text on each day."
E,The material design update completely killed my main use of a calendar.
N,I moved to Today Calendar and I'm much hapier.
E,Update ruined app.
E,Was very good.
E,Now has a terible month view and is a lot more work to find upcoming events
B,Stops working when trying to save!
R,Missing sync with fb.
R,Ad option to sync facebook calender to make it a perfect calender ap
N,Awful not worth the time.
R,Without the month or 7 day view this is just not worth the headache.
E,It is not as user friendly as older version.
E,"Alarms for apointments now suck, month calander does not display part of the last week."
R,No month view = trash.
N,I've never seen a calendar on the wall anywhere in my entire life that doesn't show you the entire month.
R,So unfortunately until I can see my whole months schedule this will remain 1 stared
N,Frustrating.
N,"For whatever reason, whenever I make a new event and try to make it longer then one hour it won't let me."
N,Beyond frustrated right now.
E,"Annoying how everytime I have to set a custom notification, deselect the sms notification and that the default notification is set for 10 days prior."
N,I enjoyed this until it became frustrating to use.
R,Simple adjustments would make this much more user friendly.
N,Thanks!
R,"Would be nice to see more than 6 hours in a day, zooming or selecting view in setings is a must."
R,Also week and month view are needed.
N,I could see my whole week at a glance in the old version.
N,Now after a couple of weeks trying I've decided it's unusable.
N,Horible.
E,Limited ways to view days of the month.
E,truly confusing to use.
N,Uninstalling.
N,you guys took something simple and made horible.
N,why is that.
N,Calendar view.
R,"It need month view and need to see what is scheduled on that day for month view, no just colored blocks for each calendar."
N,I would uninstall but the app I can installed with the features I am looking for (acalendar) needs Google calendar to sync.
N,"Now I have a phone calendar, Google calendar and the acalendar app."
E,Waste of space.
N,What a silly apI miss the previously available full month aproach and could not figure out how to enter an event in the future and  set up a notification  for a date before the event.
E,"In other words, not user friendly."
N,SNOOZE.
R,"Snooze buton please,  very important."
N,It is not good enough for Phoned.
R,Month view is missing for phones.
N,popywitch.
R,It needs some more tuning and desperately needs a month view.I use it to organise everything and want to see upcoming at a glance.
R,With a month view would be 4/5 stars
P,Great!
R,It would be better if you could ad/sync other people's schedules into the calendar like you can in the browser version.
R,"Great ap, but needs a widget."
R,"A customizable, transparent widget would be a great adition to this app."
N,Month view.
R,Bring it back.
N,if it ain't broke.
N,Went from a 5 star to a 1 star after the latest update.
R,Miss the monthly view with color blocks.
N,Now there's a circle around days with events.
N,"Guess what, every day has a circle!"
N,Used to pick colors based on the color.
E,Now color selection is buried at the botom and the colors are a tiny sliver ring with a name next to it.
N,"I really don't care what the name of the shade of dark blue I'm choosing is, sory."
N,"edit: Two months passed and not one change, downgrading to one star"
N,MONTH view.
N,Without month view.
E,This app is useless.
R,Bring back the old version!
E,"""Week"" view is terible."
E,The previous version was great.
E,The updated version is terible.
N,There's only the option to view a 5 day week and even then you can't see the whole day.
E,sync not reliable.
N,Sometimes it just refuses to sync an event with the LG Enact.
N,Uninstalled and found a replacement that works.
E,"Also, the interface was recently updated."
E,"Some features were removed, and user-unfriendly was increased."
B,Problem loading the widget.
B,Calender Widget is not working after last update!
R,No month view.
N,It is not touching it.
E,Old version was way better.
N,Is there a way to downgrade to the old version?
E,Visibility was better interface was better.
N,"This is a downgrade, Not an upgrade."
N,Week view.
N,It's just bad.
R,"We need to be able to zoom - oh, and see the whole week ."
N,Strips Hyperlinks from Body of Calendar Invites.
E,"This is a beautiful ap, but its tough to use for productivity users."
N,"This app removes all embeded hyperlinks from the body of meeting invitations such that links like ""Join WebEx Meeting"" or ""Join Lync Meeting"" apear as raw text without the web link to the meeting."
N,:-(   This should be an easy one for Google to fix.
R,No Month View?
E,It is not useful without month view.
N,The Samsung calendar is better.
B,I used it but after updates the app just doesn't work.
B,It crashes everytime
R,Bring back month widget!
N,Why did you remove ut
R,Please update dialling app as well.
P,It's not good in lollipop.
B,It is taking so much time to come pop window of sim to select.
B,Please fix bugs and provide new one for dial in.
R,"Give transparent feature for google search on screen as well for menu, it is coming in white background."
E,Become less intuitive and unstable.
E,"Extremely unstable since last update,  constantly interupting other aps to tell me it's stoped (even while I'm typing this!)"
E,"Also has become less intuitive to use,  why can't I just tap or hold a day to ad an event?"
N,Now I have to make sure it's the left most of the screen to ad an event to that day even though it's not obviously highlighted ?
E,Prety good design but.
B,Force closes when ading a contact to an event.
P,It's prety good.
N,The first time I uploaded the app.
N,didn't sync .
N,So I had to uninstall and install again .
N,Than it worked
B,It doesn't sync and crashes
R,Would  like event  stickers  i.e. birthday  etc.
P,Great but.
E,Updates sometimes are slow to be aded.
N,But more frustrating is that to change the end time it is now hiden under two menus for no reason.
N,"Used to be Great, but not now."
N,I don't know what the developers were thinking of when they re-wrote this app to the new formmat.
N,It used to be a great place to keep track of apoinments and events.
N,With a simple check of the month view one could see what was coming up in the near future.
N,"Now it does not show much in the month view, and to see the month view it has to be selected every time it is opened."
R,There is no default view.
N,if a week is selected the information of an event is truncated so much it is difficult to see what the event contains.
E,The old version the week view actually displayed a week and most of an upcoming event.
N,It is not now in this updated version.
N,Really not worth looking at it.
N,I tried to install the previous version and was blocked from installing it on Andriod 5.
N,Looks as if the developers want us to take it with no questions.
R,no month view.
R,why no month view?
R,(with viewable txt not just coloured dots) it needs a month view to be fully useful
R,It need normal month view back.
N,Frustrating.
N,Google missed the mark here.
N,"""Automagically"" awful at ading events that will be synchronized to main google calendar."
N,Went to Business Calendar app so I can ad and see an event on my phone and desktop.d
N,Ok.
R,It won't let me post a reminder
R,Month view pls
N,HTC One M8.
N,"It works perfectly for me, automatically syncs on my phone and tablet"
R,It needs improvement.
R,"Lacks month, scrolling side to side feels clunky."
R,I hate it where's the month view?
N,The old one showed the entire month and events and task.
N,It doesn't sync with widget.
N,When I ad a new event I can see it there when I've clicked on the calendar but all new events don't show up on the widget part.
N,I've almost forgoten to do something because of this.
N,I end up having to bin the widget and ad it again just so the new events show up.
B,Please fix this!
R,Maybe put a refresh buton on the widget?
N,Lollipop.
E,"Like a lollipop, this version sucks."
E,I hate the new month view since the upgrade.
N,This has gone from 5 stars to 1 star.
R,I wish I could rate it even lower.
P,Good app.
P,So far prety good
N,Month view.
R,This app needs a month view showing events on each day.
E,The new month view is still inadequate.
R,Please give me the option.
E,Disapointed in new update.
N,My favorite use of this app was looking at each month and seeing everything I had done displayed.
N,"Since I could color-code, I was able to look at a month and see how many days had green and know how many days I had worked."
N,Now I lost all of that.
N,I can't even look at a whole day at once.
N,I panicked because it looked like there was nothing on the calendar for tomorow because half of the day was cut off.
N,I'm really disapointed.
N,Don't fix something that isn't broken.
R,It needs a month view.
R,This app would be great if it had a month view.
E,Sharp Smart User Friendly.
E,It is easy backup
N,What a waist of time.
N,Hate googe +
E,Notifications suck.
E,"Good app for organizing, but notifies me for every event."
N,"No mater how many times I reset the notifications to ""none"", it always changes back by itself."
E,It is very frustrating.
P,Overall excellent but.
R,"Yep, you got it; the UI could be a bit richer"
N,Galaxy S3 CyanogenMod 11 M12.
N,Dark theme for app as well as widget.
E,"My sunrise/sunset times, moon phases and week no's doesn't sink to app."
N,Killer app.
N,Would be late for every apt wo.it.
N,Don't update!
N,Woah wth.I updated for the first time in months and promptly uninstalled the updates.
R,What kind of useless calendar app doesn't have a full week or monthly view?!
R,"Also, Google Calendar on all devices needs an option to view events in local time--as in, if I schedule two events at noon on different days in two different time zones, I should be able to view them both as being at noon instead of one of them being a different time."
N,This just makes no sense for anyone who travels.
N,month view.
E,Calendar without a month view is useless.
B,Problem sync.
R,"Facing problem Microsoft sync and not able to create event , not working with Microsoft exchange."
E,absolutely useless.
N,only updating because aCalendar recommends it.
E,Aesthetics are important.
R,"Please make a better looking widget, preferably one that's transparent, and maybe it can be aded to the notif bar."
E,"Aside from that, maybe revamp the UI to be more user friendly and less complex"
E,Prefered old layout.
E,"New layout not as user friendly, can't pinch."
N,This app has been my life saver tho :)
B,Still a litle bugy.
E,"I'm a fan of the material design and all, but the app itself has a couple of bugs."
N,"Sometimes when I'm editing an event, it will save with completely different times and dates from what I intended."
N,"Other times I have trouble geting the widget to stay up-to-date, so I have to remove it from the screen and ad it back again."
N,"Both of these are somewhat minor to me since the web interface works fairly well, but I still shouldn't have to wory about this in the app."
B,Kept Crashing Down.
B,The aplication kept crashing down even when I wasn't using it.
B,Used to crash at least 10 times every day.
N,Down grade not upgrade.
P,I used to love Google calendar.
N,Can't really live without it.
E,But now the month view is gone.
P,I HATE it.
R,I've gone back to a paper planer because of the loss of the old month view
E,Really helpful.
E,Office mail calender synch and notification by time like alarm.
N,Without internet.
N,Month View.
R,Why does tablet get a month view but phone doesn't?
E,New version wastes the acreen space.
N,"For me on nexus 5, the week view and 5 days view are unusable."
N,Nothing fits on the screen.
E,This version can't be good for anyone who really uses calendar on a smartphone.
E,This was clearly designed for a tablet.
R,Where's month view?
E,It is very useful ap
E,Great Customer experience.
E,"It is very well designed ap, you don't want to keep your eyes off it."
N,From slick to clunky in one update.
E,"Update has transformed an effective, slick, easy-to-view app into a clunky and giant-fonted app that's of very litle use to me now."
N,Gju.
N,Gfss not bfee hku hi
N,Beter off without a Calendar than using this.
N,Luckily Tim Hut has uploaded the 4.1 app which is much better.
N,I thought TouchWiz was bad until I tried Google's Phone / Contacts / Calendar and Gmail aps.
N,Can you believe a Calendar app that doesn't have a month view?
N,"Since Material started it feels like Google are deliberately writing bad aps, to push 3rd party purchases."
P,It is very goid.
E,Efficient
R,Would be a 5 star if it didn't keep ading notifications.
B,"I constantly put events in my calendar, turn off notifications and then 5 minutes later the notifications are back on!"
E,So annoying.
N,Almost makes me delete this app even though everything else is handy
E,Last update broke something I relied on.
N,"GCal reminders used to stay in my notifications until I dismissed them, and I relied on that feature to remind me of tasks that weren't done yet."
E,"Since the update, notifications disapear after the calendar event ends."
R,I can't find a seting to change that back to the old behavior.
B,Please fix it!
N,Removal of month view is an app killer.
E,Month view was the most useful feature of this app.
N,I am very disapointed that it has been removed and will probably switch to another calendar client.
E,It is very flexible views.
N,Synced with my other calendars flawlessly.
N,All items now on one calendar
N,Fine for most things.
N,"This calendar is great for entering the location of the event, using Maps to get you to your destination on time and reminding you when to leave."
R,I don't like the lack of month view or week view.
E,The 5 day view is just weird and difficult to use.
N,"I ended up using Google calendar to enter events, and HTC calendar to view the calendar because I use the week view most often."
N,Notifications.
N,"When I save a new event and indicate to have no notification, after I save there are still notifications!"
N,A sugestion.
R,A month view and that is zoomed out so it doesn't require scrolling would be really great.
N,Aadharshila Real Estate Services Jaipur
N,Well.
N,It won't let me ad any events so how can I even use it if it doesn't respond?
N,Month View in Landscape?
N,This is a big detail that is missed!
N,Would give it 5 stars right away.
R,On our smaller phones a nice month view would be great in landscape compared to the beautiful presentation on tablets.
R,Please oh please.
R,And a month widget would be great to.
R,Please hook it up for all of us who like to look way in the future!
N,Update.
R,Bring live date icon
B,Ap Closes.
B,"When I try to sync an account or create an event, I got the message ""Unfortunately, Calendar has stoped."""
E,UI is great but not the crashes.
E,The UI is awesome feels very nice to operate 
B,but as soon I try to ad any kind any kind of note on a random date it crashes.
B,please fix this with a quicker update.
E,Useless after change.
N,5 day calendar.
E,"Clean, effective, and simple"
R,No more month view?
N,They removed my favorite and most useful view.
N,The app also doesn't link to maps to choose a location anymore.
N,It doesn't sync.
B,"Before finishing installation always says ""unfortunately gmail sync has stoped"" why I did it multiple times and it doesn't work!"
E,Too big size app for a calender.
N,May have sync issues.
B,Didn't sync my phone contact events
N,Complete ap
N,What hapened?
R,Where is my month view?
N,Please.
R,somebody bring back Agendas.
P,Best mobile calendar ever.
E,It doesn't runs smoothly as it was earlier
E,New version is frustrating.
N,"Now, you can't touch and hold to ad an event on top of an existing event."
E,The new PLUS buton ads events in random spots (such as yesterday) so you have to watch closely and manually tweak every date and time.
N,Fr.
N,Gaston.
N,Nice
P,"Love it, got every thing I need and more"
R,No full calender.
N,Insanely frustrating not being able to easily see whole month view.
E,Makes the app feel claustrophobic and sucks having to scroll through week after week looking for a specific apointment.
P,Best overall calendar app.
N,"My life would literally be disorganized without this app.I forget everything, but my Google Calendar never fails to remind me."
R,"The moment I need to ad an event or reminder, I can quickly ad it to my calendar with my voice and then forget about it before I forget about it."
N,Old one was better.
E,"Sync problems, messy interface"
N,It is not up to the mark
E,New version drove me away.
R,Switched to using Today Calendar to be able to get week and month view.
E,Google is trying to be too smart.
P,Loved it
R,"Where is the time on ""schedule"" view?"
N,"I use the ""schedule"" view, formerly called ""agenda."""
R,"Since the update, my calendar items are listed in order but there is no time!"
N,I have to open the event to see the time.
R,PLEASE change this!
E,Nice Upgrade.
E,"Seamless integration from my Google Calendar to the Android widget, which is exactly what I've been looking for."
E,"I also like the design of the ap, clean and colorful with photos."
N,You'd think they would get this right.
R,Lack of month view really sucks.
E,Claustrophobic design zooms you into a week view Max.
N,From there it gets worse.
R,NO MONTH VIEW.
N,please have this as an update ASAP.
R,How can you have a calendar app with no month view
R,It doesn't have a month view and it can't even show a full week.
R,Just give me back the old calender.
R,Just give me back the old calender with a table which I can have a monthly overview that's all.
N,Going thru multiple steps just to look at the events in the month is a hassle.
P,Awful.
E,"I hate how it scrolls, its hard to keep track which month you are on."
N,I much rather have a swipe to the right or left for Month view.
E,"Compared to other calendar aps like ""informant"", this is an awful calendar."
N,Google should be embarassed to have such an awful calendar app.
R,There are so many features that it should have but doesn't.
R,No month view.
R,I can no longer see the whole month.
N,This is really frustrating.
R,Where's the month view?
E,"This new iteration of Google calendar is impressive work,  but please bring back the month view"
N,What is it?!
E,"Too much white,  too many sections that scroll differently."
R,"No visual cuts to let me know at a glance what, exactly, I'm looking at."
N,This is too much separation from what a calendar is for it to be of any use to me.
P,So good.
N,It's a nice aplication.
E,Widget sucks.
E,Googles own calendar widget sucks big time.
E,Shows off how serious is Google on design
N,V n
N,Why would you make it tedious to get to month view?
E,Hate the new update.
N,I'm using this app on my galaxy S5 and i can't view the whole month.
R,I love everything else but i really need the month view.
B,very lagy please fix even on one plus one
R,Bring back month view and 7 days week view.
R,It need month view widget
E,The older version is better.
P,Just perfect.
N,Exactly what I wanted.
E,"It is very fast, good clear widget and easy to use."
P,Excellent Cleander.
N,Wow
N,I in
N,Google Calendar.
N,Google Aps
E,"Prety fancy, but."
R,I miss a functional monthly view with event names where I can get a real overview of what's hapening.
R,I WANT MONTH VIEW BACK!
E,This app is almost useless now.
N,I share my calendar with my huby and other family members.
R,I need to be able to see at a glance WHO is doing WHAT.
N,Get your act together Google!
R,I'm  looking for a suitable replacement.
E,So confusing the new calendar!
E,Update sucks!
P,I hate it!
R,Go back to what it was pleasee.
N,Who has a 5 day week?
R,It need to be able to make notes/memos on calendar without making it an timed event or task.
E,"It works well enough on a tablet, but on a phone the UI is really badly thought out, especially the monthly view."
N,Visually impaired.
N,Great to have calander.
R,I wish you could change the background color to black.
E,Easier to see for me!
R,Just a sugestion!
N,Total bogus.
N,No use
R,Where is the month view?
N,It's OK if you only need a daily reminder.
R,"But without a full month view within the widget, this is geting uninstalled."
N,Can only view one calendar.
N,I have 2 calendars on 1 gmail account.
R,When I go to setings I see the option to make it visible but there is no save buton.
N,I end up having to use the cumbersome desktop view
N,"Belle aplication mais,."
N,- Un grand manque de fluidit?? qui rend cete aplication insuportable !
N,(Galaxy Note 4)         - Un besoin d'optimisation ??vident
N,It doesn't sync with Facebook calendar.
N,I have school pages and work project pages set up on Facebook and now I can't get it synced with my whole calendar because it doesn't have the option
B,It is not working on my galaxy core.
B,always stops
B,Keeps Quiting.
N,After updated the app just keeps quiting by itself.
B,restarting the phone didn't help.
R,need advice urgently pls!
N,A real step backwards.
R,No month view and 5 day weeks.
N,My weeks have 7 days.
N,WTF?
E,Updates that make the app worse are not cool at all!
N,Lazy Google Calendar Team.
N,"Given the amount of time this app has had to mature, it is pathetic."
N,Even calendar aps writen by random individuals are superior to this one.
E,Creating and tracking events in GCal is clumsy and backwards.
N,And options?
N,It is not really.
N,"Again, it has had more than enough time to mature."
N,After five years they ad one noticeable update for Material Design.
N,Google: fire the calendar team.
N,They suck at what they do.
E,Notifications dissapear.
N,"Used to be great but the latest update means that a notification is only visible during the event,  so if I set do my tax return for a particular day and don't do it that day then it will stop reminding me,  or it's my wife's birthday next week or take your medicine."
R,Please rectify this google to get 5 stars back!
E,New interface not cool.
N,"As SO MANY OTHERS have stated, month view is gone."
R,Should make an option to still view the old fashion way.
N,"Don't know why Google has been doing so many functional changes to all there aps as of late, but A LOT of them just are not for the better."
E,Fancy is not always better.
N,Seven day week!
E,Overall i enjoy this app but the five day week is so uneccesary and makes my schedualing quite agrivating.
R,Please give us the option at least for a seven day week!
N,My calendars are gone.
N,What hapened to the rest of my custom calendars?
N,"Now I only see ""Events From Gmail"" and ""Work."""
E,Useless to me now--using Today Calendar instead.
E,Ui not good.
E,The older calendar is more simple and great.
E,New update supose to become better but now it is suck.
R,No simplicity.
N,Why fix the unbroken?
P,"Google calendar had been fantastic for years - this update, like much of 5.0, is an insult."
N,"Why, Google, why?"
N,Unusable garbage.
R,Bring back the old one.
R,I need a full page/screen one month view as in old one .
E,The new version is to 'busy'
P,Love it.
P,Best  calendar  on market!
N,Deborah Howe.
N,So frustrating!
R,No month view.
E,The day schedule has very light hour indications.
N,I can't really see them with out my glasses on.
N,I mistook a 12:00 apointment for 1:00 because of that.
E,Bigest beef is the calendar shortcut on my home screen used to tell me the curent date.
N,Now it just says 31.
N,Come on!
P,Awesome Calendar Ap!
E,"Highlights important events in a colorful, easy to see manner."
N,Great way to stay on track!
P,Prety good.
R,Although I do wish the icon showed the curent date rather than always the 31.
E,I love how it syncs across my other Google features.
N,I just want a calendar.
N,"If I wanted something with ""prety pictures"" I would get a Playboy calendar!"
R,Please just give me a simple USEFUL calendar
N,A new bug.
E,"I don't love the new layout, but I'm geting used to it."
N,But that's not my issue here.
N,Why does the app sudenly think I'm about half a day behind my actual time zone?
E,"It's frustrating as all hell that the widget is showing expired events on my home screen, and I keep on accidentally ading today's events to yesterday's calendar."
N,Will this get fixed in an update?
B,Stoped working.
N,What can I say?
B,"I try to start it and I get a flash of it, then the oh so familiar ""Unfortunately."""
B,"Is the whole Android (and as I type this, my keyboard app crashes) phone thing a big pile of."
N,Google Calendar.
N,It is great that it syncs with all my devices.
R,"Bigest failure is there is no way to set an audible alarm on the mobile version, even though users have been beging for it for years (see forums)."
E,Newest update is not user-friendly.
E,This new update is really awful.
N,"Being unable to see the events in a single month, or even more than a six hour block in one day is simply counterproductive."
B,"PLEASE fix this to make it more user friendly, I don't want to be forced to switch from a Google aplication."
N,Monthly view.
R,"I want the ""Month"" view back."
N,I don't need any prety Calendar app.
R,I just need a functional one.
B,I just installed it and it had stoped three times in 2 mins.
P,Hate hate hate it!
N,Eror DM015K 22MB Google ???????? ?????9201L
P,Bad.
E,Says no account is linked so its completely useless.
E,Don't like the changes.
E,To start with I'd like the previous version better and this is why.
R,The month view does not show where you have apointments.
N,when scheduling apointment you can only schedule the apointment for an hour or it changes the original time.
N,So if you have an apointment for two and a half hours you have to make 3 apointments to block out that time slot.
E,"The schedule only shows a couple of hours at a time and I want to see a full day, but it won't let me."
N,Why did you mess with a good thing.
R,Could be improve to make the tool better!
R,Sugest to ad aditional option on delete / edit function for repetitive event: (1) able to perform Delete / or edit this event only.
N,"Some times, the time of ""going to church"" might change if I'm over-sea."
R,(2) able to clone / duplicate event.
R,(3) suport multiple calendar such as Chinese-lunar-calendar.
E,Looks prety but loses functonality.
N,Why can't I just have the same way it worked before but look nice at the same time
R,Bring back KitKat calender.
E,I loved looking at a FULL week schedule from 8am to 8pm.
N,Why?
N,Because I can look at free time at a glance and I HAD THE ABILITY TO ZOOM IN AND CHECK THINGS.
N,The fact that this update reduced functionality by so much to make it look better is sickening by Google.
N,Stop pulling an Aple.
B,Widget does not work after the update fix it soon
E,Nice UI.
E,Horible use of screen estate.
E,Interface moyenne.
N,L'interface depuis Lolipop est m??diocre.
R,It can ne more user friendly like before.
N,Poor with setings.
E,"I don't like it, user interface poor and bad."
R,Make some effort and make it more adjustable
N,Reverted to older version.
E,"New interface is nice but the functionality that has been aded doesn't make up for the simplifications (read: features removed: a week no longer having seven days, not being able to zoom out on week view, no month view, etc)."
N,A web search will turn up archives of older versions that you can install.
R,I need a month view.
P,I like this app.
E,I like the litle touches like the photos and pictures that go with your diary listing.
N,My husband and I frequently sync calendars which is fuss free.
E,BUT: A schedule is all well and good but I'd much prefer a month view.
R,Please include this in developments.
N,Average.
N,It's an Okay calendar.
N,Covers the basics well.
E,A bit short on syncing capabilities with third party calendars (outlook)
E,Bad interface.
R,Give me my month view back!
E,It is not hapy with new version!
N,After curent update: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONTH VIEW?!
N,And also the ability to zoom out to view the entire day at once without having to scroll?!?
E,It is very frustrating.
N,It is impossible to read the event when in the week view now.
N,Minus 2 stars.
E,"what I do like about the new update is the ability to ad ""with"" and ""at"" when you ad an event."
E,very cool feature
N,5.01.
N,something is bad.
E,This used to be my favorite calendar but layout in newest version is useless :(
E,Frustrating update.
E,Older version seemed to work better.
R,This up dated version will not show monthly apointments and often will not accept new apointments.
B,Message comes up that calendar has stoped working.
N,This is so frustrating with Google.
B,"Come on folks, you are the techie gurus, please fix this."
E,nice view.
N,only.
B,"unfortunately,  calander stops working each time i try to ad an event."
N,stock calander was much better.
N,Made by people who had no idea what calendar is for.
E,Week view is teribly useless.
E,Space allocation is teribly bad.
N,New changes.
R,"No month view, hard to navigate or see a whole month at a time!"
N,eh.
B,doesn't completely show all events.
B,please fix
N,Update.
N,"I missed an event that I had scheduled into this ""calendar"" I put it in weeks ago and because of the way that the 5 day crap is set up I wasn't able to see it."
R,Can an update come out that I can at least zoom out and see the entire 24 hours?
E,I hate having to constantly scroll up and down to see my events for the day
E,Your new update sucks.
B,It's constantly crashing out of my system I can't even program my work schedule this needs to be fixed ASAP or I will be moving to a different calendar.
N,And now you guys got rid of the month view yeah I don't think I'm going to be using Google Calendar anymore.
E,Ugly.
N,But works ok
N,Time Managing
N,Update ok
N,It works great.
R,I wish it had a widget
E,Good interface but limited widget suport.
R,Please ad month view for widgets.
R,No month view.
E,It is not liking the lack of the month view.
N,Makes it a bit of a pain for me to use
R,Month view miss
E,Entering events got harder!
R,Could be better.
R,I would like to see todays date on the app without having to open the app.
N,Iphone has had this feature since they first came out.
N,Step your game up Google
B,Why just keep crush on my note 3.
N,"I thought this app can replace the original one, but it can't"
N,Google Calender.
E,"Excellent, like how its links with my e-mails and shows flight details."
R,But would like a month view.
R,"As was on previous versions, fetch back please for 5 stars."
R,Bring back zooming and week view.
R,I can no longer see a whole week at a time.
N,In the older version I could pinch zoom to see all the events in an entire day or week.
N,Now the zoom is set for a 5 hour period and the week is 5 days long in portrait mode.
N,"I don't know about Google developers, but my week lasts 7 days and my work day often spans 12 hours."
N,Trying to find a time for an apointment used to involve simply glancing at my phone.
N,"Now I have to constantly scroll up and down, right and left, and flip my phone between portrait and landsca"
E,Older version is better.
E,I really don't like the new update.
N,When I check my schedule I wanna see the whole day.
E,"The new 5 days only screen isn't convenient, I'd rather see the whole week with the option to see all of the 24 hours just like it was in the older version."
E,The schedule option is good and it's displayed in a simple way.
R,I'd apreciate more flexibility in viewing each week.
R,No auto sync with device calendar.
R,No sync with device calendar
R,I need 7 days to fit in one screen.
N,"What is the point of geting today's 1080p phones if you are gonna enlarge the object, so they can't fit in screen."
E,I liked the previus versions when the week was on my screen and many hours could fit.
R,"Please, give bak that option!"
E,It works slow on galaxy s5
N,opo.
P,google cool
N,Month view for small screen.
R,I used to like having month view so I could see what I have going for each day.
N,I color coded different apointments or activities.
R,"Now, I can't view days in advance without scrolling back and forth."
R,Bring back month view please with color coded time frame.
N,Thanks.
N,Disapointment Once Again!
N,"Google should have their s* together by now, why such poor aps?"
R,No month view with text?
N,"As big of a company as Google is, they're making me want to switch to Aple more and more."
N,Tired of the lousy aps and barely any aps in play store with tablet suport.
N,"Shame, I've been an android fan for a long time, not anymore."
N,Next purchase is an I-Phone 6.
P,Love this ap!
E,Next to useless.
R,"No month view , full of pictures I have no use for but does not show events had to log in online !"
N,Don't bother
R,No month view.
N,For once the manufacturer installed  S Planner is better as Google Calendar has no month view
N,7 day view?
N,What hapened?
R,I want the WEEK view back!
N,"ALSO, despite constantly removing the alarms for "" this and all future events "" every week it puts the default notifications back in."
N,"I have even checked that the following weeks have no more associated notifications, yet next week the calendar will put them back in."
P,I like it.
R,I see a common complaint about no month view though.
N,It's only available on tablets.
N,It's just not useful on a phone anymore.
N,Nice app but .
R,Would be nicer if monthly view is an option again.
R,Please ad monthly view back.
N,Thanks.
P,Don't like it.
R,Please put the week number back.
N,And also.
R,a landscape view of the month
N,President /Owner.
N,"Bethesda -Rockville Limousine, Inc."
R,Recuring events don't sync and no month view.
E,It looks nice at first and then you realize that it lacks any of the functionality that you want in a calendar app.
R,Why don't recuring events sync?
N,Recent changes.
R,Bring back the month view as a full screen please.
E,The half screen view is horible.
R,No month view.
N,really?
N,"I'm all for ading more functionality, but I'll never understand why one would ever remove any functionality from an app."
E,especially something as basic as a view/layout option.
R,Why did the month view have to go.
N,Google Calendar Ap.
E,Like the navigation better with my android native calendar app.this google calendar app is not as user friendly in my opinion
E,Widget Never Displays Corect Date.
N,At least not on my Droid Max.
N,And what's with no colors on the phone but you can use colors on a tablet.
N,Huh!
N,"Come on Google, your better than this."
P,Used to be awesome.
N,Ever since they changed it I can't even find an easy way to change it back.
N,"Come to think if it, if I found a way to change it to a regular calendar layout it automatically changes back to the new layout."
N,I like to (literally) count the days to/since certain things.
N,It shouldn't be a chore to do that now.
N,1/5 until the next major overhaul.
N,"(Unless it stays ""more prety, less practical"")"
R,Missing a proper monthly view.
E,"Apart from that, it's clean, minimal and looks good."
B,Sync No working.
R,Missing events
E,older monthly view was better.
E,"update ruined a great ap, now i can't see event titles on the monthly view, which was very convenient."
R,It needs a monthly view!
N,Google Calender.
N,I couldn't get nothing done without this calander
E,Less features fewer stars.
R,"Want back: default month view, easier event handling."
N,Problems!
B,I primarily use the phone app on android and the app has sudenly stoped showing my entered events and when I go and ad new ones it won't show them at all.
N,I checked the online version and they show up there but not on my phone app.
B,Can you please fix this soon
B,It doesn't work.
B,"I can't ad events or do anything, the app opens but doesn't work."
R,"I exclusively use Google Calendar, but why isn't there an option to see all 7 days of the week or the full month?"
E,This newest update makes no sense and isn't user friendly.
R,No monthly view = I don't use it
N,Won't sync with other google calendars!
B,"Don't know why, this is a nexus 7, this app won't sync with my Samsung tab or Sony smart ."
B,"Both others sync with each other, this one sullenly sits in the corner refusing to have anything to do with my other calendars!"
P,"Good, some issues."
R,It works well but could be more flexible.
E,"Different layouts, etc"
N,Wtf.
R,Why did you take away month view?
E,Seriously dumb
E,MLD calendar looks great.
R,Would like it better if those images at the start of each month were region and period contextual.
R,Example: it would be apropriate to have bright sun or mangoes at start of April in India because it fits in the context.
B,It doesn't work.
B,it keeps stoping when I try to ad events.
B,Please fix it
P,Prety good.
N,I can't decide between this app or Sunrise.
N,They are both prety good.
E,Old version was better.
E,I dislike how zoomed in the view is.
R,I want to see 8-10 hours at once instead of 2.
N,I have changed my default reminders a number of times but they always switch back to the default setings.
N,Who would want an email reminder for every event 10 mins before hand?
N,Especially when I have my phone with me all the time to remind me anyway.
N,Somebody did not think that through.
N,Lacking.
R,"As others have said, the lack of a populated month view on my phone is a deal breaker for me."
N,"There's a screenshot of one, but it's aparently only on tablets."
N,"It's the way iPhones do it, but that doesn't make it good."
R,"Phablets can easily fit the view, so it should at least be an option."
N,"Also, because it's a Google ap, the developer email goes to a black hole."
N,Unfortunate.
N,Google calendar.
N,Review
N,Limited.
R,I wish all devices could have the same theme or apearance on every device.
R,On my LG F60 there is not the ability to start/display month from start-up.
E,Updated killed my favorite features.
N,Cant zoom in and out on the day/week view anymore and the 5 day view is useless.i want the 7 day view back.
N,I going to find another calendar app now.
R,No month view.
R,Why isn't this an option for faster viewing a schedule?
R,No month at a glance.
N,I can't find or took away month at a view events on calendar just shows lines .
R,Please bring that back.
R,I would like to view my events at a month view.
R,Give us more.
E,"Month view is essential,  in both the app and widget."
R,Also a dark version would be a welcome adition.
B,Problem Loading Widget.
B,"Yup I got that,so fix it please."
B,new version no longer works for me.
E,the new layout is completely useless.
N,went back to a paper calendar.
E,user interface was changed to useless.
N,real pain anymore to search past months.
N,"used to work, no longer."
N,manually installed old version with monthly view that actually works.
R,No monthly view.
E,Beautiful but unfriendy.
E,Just prety design but not user friendly at all Hate it.
E,The previous version on kitkat is better.
B,Fix the time glitch
N,Proof just one bad thing can ruin everything.
E,"Dear Google,   While I love almost all that you develop, this New Calander got it so so wrong."
N,There is so much feedback around the interwebs scathing of your zoomless 5 day week only calander .
N,why .
E,because it sucks.
N,"No offence to the developers, but to limit the view and a user to have to scroll up and down every time they open their calendar sux."
E,"I know you can do the list view of events, which is cool and been around in outlook since the 1990's , but not being able to glance at the week ahead in full is folley."
N,"As a small business man, being able to glance and easily see I have 2 hours between my 4pm and 6pm is handy."
N,Now I have to scroll.
N,why?
N,Only thing I can guess is you are saving screen space .
E,but the screens are geting biger!
E,Meanwhile on the web based calendar it is business as usual.
N,.7 days and 5am till 11pm.
N,and that is what we want.
B,Please fix with an update please.
N,I don't want to have to uninstall it and 're-install old version from a dodgy website just to use the old one.
N,"With much anticipation,  Dr Alex  (former 100% satisfied user)"
E,"I loved it before, now its only OK."
P,"Hey guys, I absolutely love google calendar."
E,The service is excellent and having it sync everywhere makes organizing my calendar easy.
E,I am disapointed with the new update.
N,"Whilst visually the app is stunning, its removed the seven day outlook which was a brilliant feature for my planning routine."
N,I realize I can see this when turning my device sideways but its just not the same.
N,"Aditionally, I can't zoom in or out of my calendar anymore by using pinch to zoom which made planning easier."
E,I love the design!
P,It is not that good.
N,I bong get it
P,Best seen so far!
N,So many good options for making it easier to adjust details for any event.
N,Month View.
R,Please bring it back
E,Best looks yet.
E,"I like the ""schedule"" view."
N,It's a great way to easily ad a new apointment or a meet up with friends.
E,Also the automated pictures and illustrations make it fun to scroll through you schedule.
R,"I wish they would ad a quick to-do list function or incorporate ""keep"" in it."
N,Hope this helps.
B,Widget is not working after installing the update.
N,Live it
R,Missing customizability.
E,"Way too much blank space in new look, because design."
R,"I need the 7 day week back, the ability to zoom in/out and week number displays."
R,Rolling back to an older version.
R,"Google, stop making these decisions for me."
R,Just give me the option to change it the way I want.
E,Beter before 5.0.
E,"Overall, the app is alright, but the month view is much worse than the old version."
R,And where did the week numbers go?
N,"I use that a lot when I'm planning ahead, so that is a big downer."
N,Month view.
R,This is a great app but is really frustrating without a month view.
N,Lags.
E,The scrolling is not smooth on my moto x.lags quite a bit
B,Sync problem.
R,Please check.
B,There is a problem between my google account and calendar.
B,"It won't sync and it says a problem in syncing right now please, please try again later'."
N,v5.0 unuseable.
N,Since Android 'Lollipop' unusable version.
N,I downgraded calendar manually.
R,"It works ok, but no month view."
R,Missing month view diminishes it's value.
E,It's not smooth.
E,It is really good app but it's not smooth while scrolling the agenda.
N,It doesn't sync!
R,It won't sync with other accounts!
B,Fix please.
N,Monthly View.
R,Why is the month-by-month view removed from the curent version?
N,"In this new 5-day view format, all my events just look like squashed coloured boxes with misspelled words."
N,"It was great before, but now it's not so pleasant to use Google Calendar."
P,Good but with imperfections.
E,It has an amazing design but could do with a 7-day week view instead of a 5-day view.
R,It could also give the option to follow schedules relevant to people like sports calendars or TV-show calendars and so on.
E,The widget looks nice though.
E,Update makes it not so great.
R,No monthly view of events makes this app prety bad for what I need it for
E,Prior version seemed better.
R,Please ad a month view.
R,It would give this a 5 star if the month view option was available.
N,A backward step.
E,Don't like the upgrade at all.
E,Much harder to view and even input information.
R,No proper monthly view either.
N,It doesn't deserve to be called an upgrade and should be called a downgrade.
B,Calendar widget not working after update
B,Widget stoped with Android 4.4.4.
P,Loved the app.
N,Have the built in calendar on android.
N,Now since I updated the software through AT&T to Android 4.4.4 the widget will not refresh.
B,Please fix.
N,Monthly.
R,I miss the full screen month view that showed events.
N,It seems to be designed for tablets.
E,The old version worked better on smaller screens.
N,Google Calendar on Android 4+.
R,No option to view EVENTS of the month.
N,"Also, it does NOT sync with the calendars I have selected."
N,"""Business Calendar Pro??"" is MUCH better."
R,no month view widget.
N,like in Samsung S
B,JUST DOES NOT WORK
R,Please give it a default month view so that we don't have to scroll through every day to see where we have availability.
R,Please give a month widget!
R,Zoom function missing.
E,"The old function had the ability of ""compressing"" the length of the days during week view."
E,"I really miss this, and thus makes the app less pleasurable to use."
N,Now broken.
N,They took an app that half-worked and broke it.
E,Month view is now extremely limited.
N,Moving to another app.
N,Info.
N,"Installed ap, didn't care for it, deleted it and now every thing I had on my calander is now gone."
N,WTF!
P,Soo bad!
N,"Before I could view 7 days and about 16h/day on my nexus 5 (oh the irony), now I have to scroll around like I was on an old monitor with the wrong resolution."
N,Google can't code.
R,Lost the full week view after updating :(
E,Useless.
E,Useless app.
N,There's nowhere to paste the link to my class schedule so it can be synced with the calendar.
N,Month/week views.
N,"Ruined, how can you plan the coming weeks when you can only see 5days at a time!"
N,Bonkers.
P,Great aps.
P,"This is a very good, no, it's a great app."
N,"However, I would not hesitate to up rating to 5 stars if the app can be stored in the SD card."
E,I love the schedule view but.
R,I wish it could include holidays and birthdays.
N,"In fact it doesn't sync to my Contacts, gmail or Fb birthdates!"
P,It is very good
P,Great Ap.
N,Great for staying organized
R,It needs month view as standard view option.
N,It is not just drop down month
R,Stop changing my notification setings!
P,Used to really love calendar.
E,I even kind of like the new material style.
N,But the way it keeps redoing my notification setings is driving me nuts!
N,"I want no default notifications, and it keeps ading them back in, and ading notifications that I don't want to my events."
N,Make it stop before I turn off notifications for the whole ap!
R,It would be better with a month view.
R,Month view widget required.
R,Everything is good but month view in widget is not there.
E,Update sucks.
E,The update removed features.
N,That the oposite of what should hapen.
P,This is amazing.
R,To all the people saying this doesn't have month view: Are you freaking serious?
N,You think Google would take month view out of their calendar?
N,"Tap the freaking month name to get your month view, you dumbasses."
N,Do you even bother to look at the help when you need help?
N,Yes.
P,Good ap
N,It's OK.
E,"I do like the update okay, I'm hapy with the Exchange integration, BUT, I *HATE* the colors they assigned to my outlook calendars and there is no option to change the colors."
R,Please let me pick my calendar colors.
E,Most user friendly
N,lousy compared to business calendar.
R,"no dark theme, no month view."
N,you installing now.
E,better to stick to business calendar
E,Why the stupid update?
N,Since you updated the app it's bad!
E,You can't see nothing everything is too colourful and you can't find stuff.
E,Curent 5 days view is no good.
R,Can't see the whole week's schedule.
E,previous version was much better.what's worst.
R,cannot resize the column height (ridiculous)
P,Love it.
E,It is brilliant quality and is a very unique item
R,"""month"" view no longer shows events."
N,"Since the latest major update, the month view has been replaced."
E,The new view no longer shows events on it.
N,"Personally, this is a usability regression as that was the main view i used."
E,"Apart from that, the app is excellent, and if you don't use the month view you're fine."
N,On my phone i was able to uninstall this app to come back to the old version.
N,If you're lucky this might work for you as well.
R,No full month view!
B,Fix it and I will give 5 stars.
N,I feel so mad about this I took time to type this rare review
E,Clean and simple.
E,Loving the new material design.
E,It is easy to use along with a clean unclutered look makes it infinitely better over the mess that is splanner.
P,Love it.
N,Especially for the new updated version!
E,Everything is smooth and nice!
E,And I really love the idea of auto sync of my flight schedule from gmail to here!
N,Keep it up google!
N,Kwame Nelson.
P,It is very good very good
R,It needs FB suport.
R,Please ad functions to see birthdays of our Facebook friends in the app.
N,The Google calendar:.
E,Dependable.
E,Invaluable.
N,Just the thing.
N,:-) Not to be missed.
R,Where's month view gone?
E,Month view was useful.
R,Having an at a glance day view would be better also.
R,No Zoom.
R,"Hi Google, Calendar is good except for one thing, there is no zoom option!"
R,"Please, Please bring back the zoom option."
E,"The old version was better, because we could see the events ( and colours of those) on the monthly view: and that was prety awesome."
R,Unfortunately this version of calendar does not have that option.
R,It needs improvements.
R,No widget?
N,Pass.
E,"Awful, slugish crap!"
E,It is very slow.
B,"And if I want to set a reminder longer than 30 minutes, which means a custom job, the whole app freezes and crashes and sometimes takes my phone with it."
E,"This is bugy, slow, frustrating crap."
R,"No full day, no month view."
R,"I can't see an entire day, making me miss upcoming events because I just don't see them."
R,"Also no month or week view, only 5 days."
E,Reminders don't work.
N,"Notification reminders do not work, they go off hours after the event has taken place."
N,Will be installing another calendar app if this doesn't get fixed.
N,Went down.
N,"Used ti be a 5stars now is just barely one, stoped using it completely"
N,RAM eater.
P,This is the best calendar app I've ever used but consumes up to 150 MBs of RAM.
N,Come on Google.
N,Fix this;make it less resource-needy.
N,Thanks.
N,In new update.
E,main menu disable transparent.
B,So kindly fix it
N,"Every time you edit and save an yearly event, it sets the date by 1 day earlier."
B,What an annoying bug!
E,HATE THE NEW FORMAT!
N,Default event time.
N,Why is this even a thing?
R,I should be able to adjust the length of an event without diging through setings.
E,It is very frustrating.
N,"Such a shame, because this is otherwise a great ap"
R,"Beter, but the widget needs work."
E,"Lovely full screen layout now, could do with a similar widget."
R,Lacking a lot of decent widgets really.
E,HATE CHANGES.
R,Where is my month view?
E,"I hate this new version, please help me get my calendar back."
N,Btw.
N,normal people don't have time to keep relearning calendar formats.
N,VERY SAD HERE!
B,creating events doesn't always work.
N,any time i try to create an event it almost never saves the ui for creating an event is also kind of confusing
N,What's hapened.
E,It was so simple before the update.
N,Now I can't get it to sync with my Android.
E,It syncs okay on ios devices
R,Month view needed.
R,Month view is very essential !
P,I don't like it.
N,It doesnt suit me well.
N,Did anyone ask the users?
N,I have to echo what others have said here.
E,The month and day view changes have ruined this.
N,I found the APK for the previous version and reinstalled that.
E,lovely and smart.
P,Cool ?? cool cool
N,Sync.
R,Wont sync with other devices
E,Older versions were better.
N,"I would have given 4 stars for the older versions and while I like the system of the map coming up for places in the new one, I HATE that you can't see the schedule for a whole month on the same screen."
N,"If your next upgrade involves that change, I'll give you 5 stars!"
E,Useless due to lack of features.
R,The curent calendar app lacks the most basic features such as month view.
R,Let alone all the functions and setings of the calendar website interface.
E,This app is useless to all but the most basic user
R,Bring back weeknumbers.
E,A calendar is worthless without it.
E,It is very Nice Calendar.
E,"I like this calendar, especially the widget."
N,"I DON'T KNOW WHY SOMETHING PPL ARE COMMENTING ON THE THERE NOT BEING A MONTH VIEW BUT IF you CLICK ON THE MONTH'S NAME, IT WILL SHOW you THE WHOLE MONTH."
N,Anyway no complaints yet.
P,4 stars bcuz it's not my favorite android calendar bit it's prety good.
N,Thanks for the app.
N,Thanks for the ap
R,It doesn't Sync with my Google account.
N,Unbelievable
R,Schedule Scaling needed.
R,They need to be able to change the scale of the Calendar app to different granularities on the week schedule.
N,"They had this before so you could change it, but got rid of it in the new update :( was my favorite,  now its unusable."
N,Change for a five star
N,Garbage.
E,The new Google calendar is completely unusable.
E,Lots of wasted space.
N,"Removal of several basic features, such as pinch to zoom."
E,Useless month view.
R,Why change layout.
N,They have completely changed how it views on screen.
E,Now a week view is only days.
N,Delete find bettervone
R,I miss seeing 7 days.
R,Please include end time of events in the widget!
E,New update sucks.
E,Calendar was easy to set up and worked as intended but now it auto ads notifications and constantly double ads events when editing the event rather than actually changing the edited event.
E,Poor new layout.
E,The new layout makes it very hard to see my work shift patern like i could before.
R,Even if the month view went back to the old way it would be much more usable.
N,Atrocious.
E,"It doesn't sync, the layout is horible, it's hard to find events that you ad, and just overall is poor."
N,Just trash it and use something else.
E,Looks nice but has lost functionality.
E,The material design update has taken away the ability to view a entire day.
N,I am constantly glancing at my calendar and thinking I have nothing on that day but if I scroll down later I find I do.
N,Third in portrait mode I don't see the entire 7 days of my calendar and have to scroll across.
E,Feels less functional as a calendar app.
N,How to jump to old calendar years quickly?
R,"If I want to check back a date five years back, what I can do is fliping quickly on month view or scrolling endlessly on schedule view?"
N,Monthly view.
N,It was perfect until they remove the month view !
N,Horible!
E,Too messy.
R,No month view sucks.
E,"Seriously, I hate the new version."
R,"I want to be able to view a month at a time, and am going to have to search for an app with that functionality."
N,"I loved  Google Calendar, until this ""new"" version."
N,It's crap.
N,Guted.
N,"It won't actually let me use it, I try to ad an event or whatever and it closes the whole thing  down ."
N,Month view?
E,This app is now useless after the update.
N,Why destroy the best ap?
R,"No good month view, and no visible events."
R,"Looking for 3rd party calendar now, first time ever."
E,Last version was better.
R,Why can't I have full screen month any more?
N,"And now when I ad events they only show up on the web client, not the mobile version."
E,Update sucks.
E,"I really liked the widget, the ability to see a whole month, the full week instead of five days, more links within the app such as being able to click a day in week-view and go to that day."
E,This update changed everything I loved and I HATE this calendar now.
N,Monthly view?
E,"The continuous monthly view it had before was smooth, seamless, and so useful."
N,Why would you take that away and make us scroll sideways and not down?
R,Bring it back please.
N,Won't sync.
N,The calendar will sync to my gmail on the pc
P,It is not bad.
R,I miss the month view.
R,It is not being able to see a preview of your month is annoying.
R,Please bring that back with next update.
R,Where is month view?
N,Title
N,Me encanta la organization que tiene y como me encausa mis que haceres mi Google calendario.
N,Es un secretario fabulous!
N,Es el mejor secretario que existe
P,Great aps
N,Prety.
E,"Lots of functionality but I'm really a fan of the whole look, its very nice to look at."
R,Just wish there was a month view.
N,Chinese lunar dates.
P,This is a great app.
R,Would be even greater if there is an option to ad the Chinese lunar calendar dates to display within.
N,Now I am having to use another calendar with such function.
R,Google please consider this for the mobile app.
N,You have this function on the desktop version.
N,Thanks.
R,I want my old calendar back!
N,I have an apointment in 2 weeks.
N,I have to click on that day to see it.
R,There is no way to view a monthly calendar with a day highlighted with an event.
E,New update is rubish
R,Lack of full-month view fatal flaw.
N,"I'm running this on a 5.5 inch cell phone screen, but because the app thinks it has to run in phone instead of tablet mode, I can't see my full month of apointments, which is my primary need from my calendar app."
N,There's not even a seting to switch over.
E,Cripling design decision.
N,You're better off with Jorte.
R,No month view.
N,"I used to LOVE this ap, but after the new update, I can't see the whole month at once and that was my favorite part."
R,Please bring it back :(
P,It is not as good.
N,"Lots of changes, and not for the better."
N,This version ads more steps to common tasks without any aded benefit.
N,Huge step back.
E,Haven't liked this app since the huge UI overhaul.
E,Wastes huge amounts of on screen space with unnecessary graphics.
E,Event reminders disapear too quickly.
N,Do not update.
N,"Calendar now has ""feature"" making event notifications timeout after an hour so you may never see them."
R,Please ad option for notifications to remain until swiped away.
N,Nexus 5
P,Amazing.
N,It works amazing on a samsung phone
E,Fletcher is right.
N,"It's almost a sweet ap, but it's unusable because you can't default to a month view, then tap to enlarge a single day."
E,It is not enough customization.
N,CAN'T SINC MY CALENDAR.
B,After lollipop's update my calendar doesn't work properly.
R,I can't creat evernts or at least see them.
E,"The calendar is just a normal calendar that shows me date, jut anything else."
P,HATE IT.
B,"PLEASE GOOGLE, FIX THAT"
N,Just downloaded.
P,Love it so far!
E,Upgrade is more like a downgrade.
N,If there were any update I could undo it would be this one!
E,Most upseting part is not being able to see as much.
N,"Old version showed you a full 7 day week, now I can only see 5."
N,Old version allowed you to shrink the days so you could see more and this one is frozen in one size.
E,"So ultimately it feels less free, more restrictive."
N,"A disapointment for sure, I will be searching for a workaround to get the old version back."
B,Keeps crashing.
B,Every time I try to ad something it crashes
N,Disapointment.
N,Is that all Google you can do?
N,Unfortunately this product falls into below expectations category.
N,With all resources and money Google have product like this with so limited functionality should not even be released as beta.
E,"Onlin calendar in Google is bad, but this one is even worse."
N,It is not worth atention.
B,Crashes.
B,Crashes while selecting contact when typing title.
E,Too much zoomed in.
N,Used to view at once the whole day 9 to 17.
N,Cannot do the same anymore.
E,Don't like this change.
N,Ashwini.
N,Nice ap
E,New interface is confusing.
N,Beware of creating an event with a wrong date in this new interface.
N,"It is so prone to mistakes and if we do not double check the dates, we would end up missing the events."
E,Confusionary.
E,I prefer the old version
N,Duplicate Event Still Not Present.
N,Shocking that you still can't duplicate an event or create a template.
E,Latest version is very bad.
N,"Month view is gone, creating an event by clicking on a specific day is thus impossible."
N,Creating reminders takes more clicks.
E,"It looks fancy, but it's horible to use."
E,Notifications disapear!
B,:o. I have missed so many notifications because the notification disapears when the event ends :( I am not constantly on my phone and I enjoyed seeing my notifications anytime after the event.
R,I really hope this is fixed because this was the most useful app and I used it every day and it has now lost most of its usefulness to me.
N,I'll try another and hope Google fixes this soon
R,No zoom.
R,No landscape mode.
N,at least on my phone (Galaxy Note 3).
P,Best calender.
P,Love this calendar.
E,Bright and easy to use.
E,The widget is perfect.
E,Calendar events aren't syncing
E,Updates going backwards.
N,Why do I now have to tilt my phone to see week view when I could see it fine  without tilting it before?
N,Why do I have to completely un-sync an account when previously you could get second account emails without it showing in your calendar?
N,Leave well enough alone!
N,What have they done?
N,"This used to be a good, reliable solid aplication that was my go-to calendar."
E,The latest version I was upgraded to at the start of February  is rubish - it has a horible user interface.
B,And it crashes.
P,I HATE it
N,ok try
B,Please fix month and week view!
N,Looks fab
N,Nice APP.
E,"I like it, useful and graceful"
E,"It is nicely designed, but."
B,"scrolling causes noticeable stuters, even on an HTC One M7."
R,"If that were to be fixed, this could be the best calendar on Play."
N,Removed the month view?!
E,This calendar is now useless!
N,"You can only make sense of the 5 day planner, anything you want out in the future you have scroll your way to find."
N,Back to the ugly Samsung calendar for me.
R,No month view.
N,Can't use my calendar properly without month view
E,The month view is a terible ui
N,Reminders.
N,"Whenever I create an event I always set it for no notifications, but after 24 hours it turns notifications on and I have to go back and edit it again."
N,Then it doesn't come back.
N,Don't update to this.
N,I updated calendar and all my birthday events are lost or deleted automatically.
E,Disliked this update.
N,Material.
E,"Looks very nice, but it far less functional."
R,I miss the old version
B,Force closes every single atempt.
B,Force closes on samsung s3
P,Good.
R,More widgets please!
N,And alow syncing facebook birthdays dates
B,Bugs.
B,Won't sync and keeps crashing.
R,I wish I could revert to the previous version.
R,No month view.
R,No month view.
R,And no ability to ad picture
B,Widget stops working after update.
B,It says error with sync after update
N,Please!
R,Bring back the month view!
N,It's VITAL for my scheduling!
N,Month view?
R,Where did month view go?
N,"By far my most used view, I can't see at a glance which days have apointments anymore!"
P,Improved and best calendar ap
N,Blah.
R,No month view is a bummer.
E,The tiny month view is really disapointing
R,Can't zoom out in week view.
E,"I quite like the new color scheme of the material design update, but functionality wise it has been a downgrade."
E,"The month view is absent, and I can no longer zoom out in week view to see the full day at once."
E,The ability to cut off the early hours of the day view has gone too.
N,It seems Google lately prefers to cut features from their aps instead of ad them.
N,"Well, I've been cuting Google aps from my phone lately and ading third party ones."
R,It needs return of monthly calendar
N,"Latest update (well, as at 11 Feb 2015)."
R,I do wish the poor chap who's siting in the basement of wherever these aps are developed could be given something more constructive to develop.
R,"In the latest release this litle chap has decided to ad a useless banner of scenery,  thereby using up precious screen space, which could more useful utilised by giving the actual purpose of the ap, namely the diary, more screen space."
R,"Please, Google, let's keep things simple and efficient."
E,Do away with these silly useless gimmicks.
N,I've only given this more recent release 3 stars as it rather annoys me!
R,Where's the default month view?
E,I like the app but I can't get the default view set to monthly because I don't have that option.
B,It does not work.
B,"Every time I try to ad a new event, it closes, making the app useless."
B,This problem has existed for over a month.
R,It need month view back urgently!
N,Month view was my daily use.
N,Trying to find a new app to use instead.
R,Please ad it back in!
N,V. Frustrating
N,It works great.
P,Love it
R,No week view?
N,"Newest update takes away the option to view a week or month at once, but now I can choose my colors by name?"
E,The new update lost various good features in favor of a flashy design.
R,"I would much rather have a simple design that works well, is user friendly, and will let me see the whole day and week at once."
N,Uninstalling.
E,It is not even useful without month view.
N,If I can't view my schedule a month at a time this app it not even useful to me.
N,Uninstalling
P,It was perfect.
N,But not so on Mi3.
N,I set a reminder it shifts to a day before.
N,Automatically.
N,Maybe xiaomi built this bug so that people don't use this app.
R,But whatever be the case i cannot set a reminder using this.
N,This is a huge disapointment.
B,The calendar won't sync with my S5 and every time I try to ad an event it shuts down.
N,I have reported it numerous times to no avail.
N,I thought Google was better than this.
N,Google calendar app.
N,I am not likeing this app one bit.
E,It is not as user friendly.
R,There is not a monthly calendar view.
N,I have to do a lot of scolling.
E,Notification is not easy to set up.
N,I guess I will have to forget this app and use one I like.
N,It does not sync to my online calender as it had previously.
N,Disapointed!
P,Good not great.
E,Pros: look and feel.
R,"Cons: widget does not allow a month view, cannot adjust to open the app in month view"
R,It needs a month view with texts and some normal usable widgets again with text (week and month view)
N,Geting two notifications.
P,I like it.
E,"It is not great, but the native calendar app on my moto x continues giving notifications along with the google calendar."
N,When I went to unsync calendars in the native program it also unsunc the calendars on the google calendar app.
E,Sort of annoying.
N,Thinking of just going with the native calendar.
R,It was better with the month view.
N,Can't sync from my Galaxy cell and tablet!
N,This app won't allow me to ad an apointment on one and see on the other.
N,What's the issue?
R,Where is month view after upgrade to lollypop?
R,It does not show month view.
N,It works well.
E,The wigit doesn't refresh.
P,It is very Unlike Google!
E,I use all of googles aps because they're so simple and effective and brilliant and genius and brilliant and did I say brilliant?
R,But with this one I do not understand why oh why there is not a monthly view for the widget.I felt like crying.
N,"Anyway still not downloading an alternative, I trust google enough to fix this asap."
N,"Great to have this, thanks."
R,It needs a month view on phones.
R,"It's extremely hard to plan when i can't look at my month at a glance,  give us a month view back on phones and I'll give it five stars."
N,Monthly View.
R,A monthly view would be much more useful.
N,It is not sure why its a  sugested view in the images above if it's not an actual feature of the app.
R,Birthday reminder still not allowed.
R,No repeat date.
R,"Get rid of all the graphics, repeat date doesn't work."
R,"I want a plane clean calendar, this doesn't do it"
N,Frustration.
N,Occasionally when creating an event with a start and an end time on a different day the date will change unexpectedly.
B,Also occasionally when creating a new event it will not show in the agenda view without closing and we opening the app.
R,No month view.
R,Gogle you have to bring back the widget month view!
N,I can't live without it.
R,Where's Month View?
R,How can you have a calendar without a MONTH view?!
E,New calendar is very useful :).
E,The new calendar is excellent.
E,It is very well designed features.
N,"Never used it before, but using it all the time now."
R,No month view widget!
R,Please ad month view widget
N,Can't sync / create tasks.main reason why I wanted this app.
R,Makes no sense to not be able to.
E,No better than a stock calendar app.
R,Can't do a full week view.
R,Also can't see mouth than a 4 hour time frame.
P,THE WORST CALENDAR APP EVER!
N,Whoever thought that this design for a way for a calendar to function was a good idea should be taken outside and SHOT!
N,It is perfect for some idiot with nothing to do.
R,"There is  no way for someone to see their schedule for a day, week, or month in one view."
N,"In the monthly view, the days with apointments are NOT MARKED AT ALL."
N,Only the days with nothing scheduled are marked.
N,This would only be useful for someone who only does 1 thing per day.
N,Do yourself a favor and avoid this app like the plague.
N,New look.
E,I love the new look with the latest update on my droid ultra
P,Worst.
N,Version.
N,Ever.
R,No month view?!
E,"This is the epitome of taking a simple easy to use app and turning it in to a completely useless, needlessly convoluted horor show!"
N,"If this new ""improved"" version can't even do the simplest of basic tasks that the old version could then how in the hell do you call it an improvement?!"
N,It's made this app totally unusable so I'm going to uninstall and get a calendar that can at least show a month at a time - I mean really what kind of calendar has no month view?!
E,Unnecessarily complicated.
N,Ok app.
R,I would give it 5 stars but NO MONTH VIEW!
N,Get it together Google!
P,It works bad now.
E,The older version was so much better.
E,The whole design is shot now.
B,It doesn't work well.
N,Month view!
E,It is a good app and the interface has improved much but please ad month view.
E,Hate the new UI.
N,Why does Google insist on changing ui for the worse.
E,I hate the new lollipop layout in the calendar app.
N,Old one has a great week view.
E,It is sleek and very functional.
N,Going to stop updating the calendar app until they go back to a sensible ui.
N,Bring.
N,Back.
N,Month.
N,View.
N,"What are you, facebook?"
R,"You used to be cool, google, now you're making updates nobody needs and taking away features people love and trust."
E,Terible design :-(.
N,"I installed it so I could sync with my Google calendar on my laptop, but once I saw the way it is laid out I immediately uninstalled it."
E,This is a terible design!
R,I need to see the month view the way the old app was set up.
E,"I don't need a lot of extra graphics, I need to see my events at a glance in a manner that is easy to read."
N,I'll stick with the old app for now.
R,Prefer week view instead of 5 day.
P,"I love this ap, and use it every day!"
E,"I really like the new look and feel, but it's just not as easy for me to view my schedule unless I can have a week view that can snap from week to week instead of just scrolling."
N,This feature is something that I look for in a tool as vitally important to my daily life as this one.
N,Why the update?
N,Crap.
E,"really really really bad layout, bad and ugly widget."
E,It is not useful.
E,Without the full month view this app is now next to useless for me.
E,It is very useful ap
N,Google REMOVED the month view?!?!?
N,Why Google?
N,Just why?
E,Great and useful software app.
E,I forget things sometimes and this app is very useful to keep ahead of schedule.
P,Good ap
R,No Month View.
N,I personally like to keep my calendars on month view.
R,"Unfortunately, while I like this ap, you curently cannot switch to month view."
N,"You can get a small month view by swiping down but can't see what's scheduled for when, etc. in that litle window view."
E,It is not intuitive UI.
E,I much prefered the old UI.
E,It's totally still achievable with the new design!
N,"It's just very random, like creating a new item - could default to any day instead of just opening a new one for today."
E,Modern and Functional.
P,"The more I use this ap, the more I love it."
E,Bad update!
N,"Before this recent update, it worked so smooth and you were able to see all the events in one screen."
N,"I was able to quickly and easily ad an event, but now its all a bunch of fancy options and clutered tasks."
R,I am no longer able to make an event from one time to midnight without it freaking out and changing dates.
E,"Super annoying update, please revert!"
E,For now it's less good than before.
N,The removal of the scrolling month view has lessened my rating of this otherwise okay calendar.
N,Perhaps as time passes I'll get more accepting of it.
B,Bug with Changing Recuring Meetings on Exchange Server.
B,"When changing the time of a single instance of a recuring meeting, it changes all the occurences in this calendar and none of them the server."
B,Please fix.
E,New views less useful.
N,I'm not a fan of the five day view.
R,I'd prefer to see my week and my month.
R,"I also miss the ability to pinch and adjust the size of the display, so I could see my whole day in a glance."
N,"Still using it because it's synced to my main calendar, but looking for another option due to these changes."
N,It just isn't anywhere as easy to see apointments when they're all squashed together like this.
R,Why no month view on a phone?
N,I liked it for the first several days until I realized there is no view of the whole month available for a phone- but there is for a tablet.
N,In the examples shown there are month views.
R,"I hoped this would be THE  calendar app for me, but I'll keep looking."
E,Worthless.
R,No month view makes this app impossible to use.
N,Google must not look ahead.
R,No Exchange apointments after update.
N,"After today's update to the ap, my calendar lacks any apointments from my corporate (MS Exchange) account."
N,Only my google account's apointments show.
E,"However, the corporate account is still listed in the prefs."
E,Craptacular!
R,No proper month view.
N,Really Google?
N,Decreased my rating because removing one of the basic functionalities from the calendar (scrolling month view) is unacceptable even if you are Google.
R,No month view
E,New version is so much worse.
R,"Dear Google review reviewers, Please allow me to view the full day on my screen like I used to."
R,Please let me see the whole week on my screen like I used to.
R,Please let me look at my events by month.
N,Why would you do this to me?
E,I loved the old calendar.
P,"Good, but."
B,Crashes while create new task
R,Missing something.
N,Nice app.
R,"It works well on Acer tab but, doesn't show me the US holidays."
R,I wish I had that part.
B,It's crap it keeps shuting down
N,Dine in or we'll poison your takeaway!
E,New graphics = visual cluter.
E,And they detract from the aesthetics of the otherwise mediocre UI.
R,Where's the option to turn this crap off?
N,"I know what a hair cut is, don't need a graphic with a hairdryer from G to restate the obvious to pretend to ad value."
N,"G also degrades the cal when sunrise grabs it and inserts text ""for a better experience"" (I.e. without this stupid text inserted into calendar) use GCal."
N,Dine in or we'll poison your takeaway!
N,"G is just the new F.  Now, 6 or 6+."
N,Hmm.
R,Month calendar missing.
R,"No month calendar, common, implement this again."
E,usability is so bad after the update.
N,seriously.
N,new version REGRESSION.
E,"The calendar has been redesigned, and on phones at least, it is much worse than the old versions."
E,The number of regressions seen here is almost shocking.
N,"You can no longer pinch zoom to ""zoom out"" of a view and see more information."
R,"There's no month view on phones, which there is definitely room for on the 6-inch Nexus 6 (which, as the newest Nexus device, Lollipop is suposedly developed on); the most you can do is see a mini calendar."
N,Week view has regressed from a seven-day view in portrait mode to a five day view?€?but it still shows the same number of characters per line.
E,"Everything is biger, but more space is taken up by the less important parts of the calendar like the date and time."
E,"The agenda view shows a litle picture at the beginning of each month, and a fancy parallax scrolling effect shows different parts of the picture as you scroll."
E,"But this screen scrolls poorly, with lots of stuters and frame drops."
P,It is not Good Anymore.
R,It is not able to use with Outlook calendar
R,No month view!
R,Give me back month view and I will give five stars.
N,I'm caught between loving this and another calendar both of which work seamlessly together so I often flit between the two depending on the strengths I'm after.
E,Dislike widget!
E,"I love the idea/look of ap, but hate the widget."
E,Can't change default view and it wastes screen space on large blank white areas.
E,I'll keep using Business Calendar because it's simply superior.
R,No month view any more.
N,So sad.
N,This used to be a well used app.
R,In my work I regularly need to see my month view.
N,Since that disapeared I have switched to another app for my calendar.
N,I would rather use the Google app since it seemed to work seemless with my Google business account.
E,Looks good.
N,Previous issues were fixed.
N,Could use a search function though.
R,It need monthly wiget.
R,There needs to be a monthly view wiget.
E,New material design is terible.
R,No month view is a deal breaker
E,New update is horible.
R,"Still no month view, still not updating."
R,No Month feature.
N,I liked it before but now they got rid of the month feature.
R,PLEASE bring back month view to phones.
E,I like listing my exams on Google Calendar and the Agenda view is very annoying.
B,Crashes.
B,Crash crash crash
E,Loving the new calendar
E,Useless without the month view.
R,I wish I could disable its notifications.
N,My only reason for keeping it is the sync.
N,Gone back to my phone calendar.
E,Became worse.
R,"No zoom, no functional month view, waste of display space"
P,Amazing.
R,It would be awesome if you guys created a phone/tablet widget for this app.
N,So far no issues
N,Month View.
R,It needs a month view with details without having to select a day.
N,Google Calendar Widget.
N,I used to have it on my phone it was very useful until I accidentally deleted it.
E,I was hoping you had an app but you don't I looked for it in my Nexus 5 but the widgets section disapeared after the recent update.
N,Help!
R,"I like it, but I wish when I change the start hour/minute of an event, it doesn't change the end hour/minute."
N,It's annoying to have to change the end time back to what it was just because I changed the start.
B,Google calendar doesn't work?
B,"My Gmail will sync with any calendars I've reset, power cycled and no progress."
N,What is going on?
P,Like it but downloaded it.
R,Because I thought it would display the whole month.
R,I need a widget that shows the whole calendar.
R,If you ad this would rate 5 stars
N,Monthly calendar.
R,I wish I there was an month widget so could see from the monthly calendar if i have something important like apointments or deadline  due on a day .
N,With my work and school schedule.
R,I really need to see what is upcoming and due.
N,Ok.
N,It doesn't ad events when offline.
N,Ugh.
E,It works it's nice looking.
R,Why tf did you remove the functionality to click the date in schedule view to get the expanded day view.
R,Updates shouldn't remove functionally.
N,It takes a much less intuitive aproach to get the same thing done and also the wrong day is launched 60%+ of the time.
E,That was a poor judgment call.
E,The calendar is geting worse.
E,It is not a good look.
N,What on Earth?!
N,"I usually welcome big updates and redesigns to aplications.but this for me feels like a step backwards, Google!"
E,"This app was so much simpler to navigate around before, and now I just seem to get confused when I use it."
N,"I mean, what hapened to month view?"
N,Surely that was a necessity.
N,No details.
R,Geting better but still needs a year view.
R,Why would you remove the monthly view?
N,Monthly view no longer available!?
N,What the heck.
P,This SUCKS!
R,"At least give me an option to go back to the ""classic view""."
P,Good not Great.
E,Love that tasks sync with Inbox and the calendar app.
N,Would now like to be able to create reminders from within the app instead of via Google Now or Google Inbox.
R,Also would like to see a month view included.
P,good job
N,Widgets.
N,I have to say this calendar makes better use of my screen space than the default one that is baked into the os.
R,I would like the widgets to be more customizable.
R,A big white calendar widget is a no-no on a darker themed home screen and Google should not pretend it knows best for everyone in this manner
R,Missing the month view.
R,"Like a lot of things about this, but I do miss the ""month view""."
N,It doesn't sync w changes made online from laptop.
N,Changes in app often unresponsive.
E,The pre-installed calendar app that came w my Samsung note i was way better than this new calendar app.
N,It was able to sync real-time whenever I made changes online from desktop.
N,Now Google made us install their own calendar app.
B,This app failed to sync w changes made online thru laptop 99% of the time.
E,It's horible!
B,Restarting device doesn't help either.
N,"If it weren't for the fact that all my work schedule is linked to Google account, I'd stop using Google calendar altogether."
R,Where are the Tasks.
E,I like this calendar I use it a lot but where are Google tasks.
N,None of my tasks sync from the browser to this app.
R,There isn't even an option to select tasks.
R,Please ad this many people will find it useful.
E,"Slick, but clutered."
R,I really miss the detailed month view.
E,"Even the week view is difficult, as it won't show the whole day, just time."
N,The old calendar (KitKat) would show month and week view and allow you to see all of the apointments in a given day very easily.
N,Now there is way to much scrolling to find all of your apointments.
N,Or Dell Ross
P,Good calendar.
P,This is a good calendar
N,Zero stars would be better.
E,New interface sucks unless you are a google fanboy
B,Crashing.
B,When were I tray to ad an event it stops working and crash I'm using moto g 1st gen.
E,Previous version was better.
R,Can't even view a week at a glance.
E,More cumbersome and a ton of reminders you have to turn off or modify.
R,Can I get the old one back.
N,Events aded on galaxy 5s not syncing.
N,Events that I create on my phone are not syncing anywhere.
N,Defeats the purpose of cross platform aps; the reason that I chose to use Google products first place.
B,"Fix asap, please!"
N,Month view?
R,My bigest complaint is that there is no month view.
N,It makes it so hard to use the ap
N,Nice.
N,It's eye candy and straight forward
R,It need month view.
