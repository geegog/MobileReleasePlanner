P,This is definately the best keyboard to type and predict.
R,"Great with more themes, but I still want more and one could hope it could go for open development."
E,The buttons are to small for my big fingers.
R,Is there a way to make this for larger hands?
N,A lots of language to choose from!

N,Very close to uninstalling... Please do advise.
N,Thanks.
N,These things are horrible for anyone who doesn't swype.
B,It's always deleting words and the only solution is to turn on flow which causes worse errors.

B,"While writing this sentence too, SwiftKey corrected at least 10 errors of mine!"
N,LOL.

B,"I like this keyboard, but why it lags when scrolling through the emojis?"

P,Love it.

N,Can't get over how good it predicts.
E,Flow typing is awesome!
E,Awesome setup and crazy good text predicting.
E,I also like how it is easier than the standard keyboard to input slang.
B,"Samsung Galaxy, Android 4.1.2; about once a week, while using the keyboard, my phone freezes and the only way to get out is to remove the battery."
N,"Only ever happens when the keyboard is in use, in any program."
N,Still happening as of 8/25/14.
E,Very intuitive keyboard.
R,Wish it had swipe functionality like the Google keyboard for swiping through the space bar accurately.
E,And it can be just a little slow as compared to stock keyboard.
N,But even then it deserves the 5 stars.
E,The emoji is in blocks.
R,Maybe it needs some more help.
N,"Used for two months but, went back to Swype."
E,"I get more accurate hits, the trail is smaller, the possible word options is much larger and seems more responsive."

P,Great.
E,SwiftKey is great at predictions.
E,"Nice layout options, customizable, variety of colors/themes."
E,"Word prediction is great, but as far as autocorrect goes I don't know if it's just horrible or if I'm a sloppy swipe typer."
P,Great!
E,Feature swipe in Bahasa Indonesia is great!
B,"Keeps telling me that ""no language pack is installed"" ."
N,"I keep re installing and have to do this at least twice a day, very tiresome."
E,Well my mobile it s very easy.
N,It's legit.
R,Why dont you provide option to disable it ?
E,Butyful system.
R,Does everything i need with a slick look.
E,Predictive spelling is great but sometimes a bit annoying as with technical jargon.
E,Otherwise better  than the factory text app.
P,Great app really.
E,TERRIBLY annoying.
N,"Kii has  better  swipe word  recognition,  and  isn't  always  trying  to  add words  in  that  I didn't  type."
E,"Got tired of the CONSTANT insertion of spaces, the fact that it seems to ""learn"" typos at a greater rate than actual words, and with the last few updates you can't move the cursor where you want and edit what you are trying to write."
R,No match for Samsung's Swype - still hoping they release a stand alone version of that.
N,Suka.
P,"Excellent,  highly recommended."
P,So amazing.
N,You can type fadt.
E,Never seen such an easy to use and beautiful keyboard ever.
N,So far extremely happy from using this.

P,The feel is grt swipe is awesome  love it.

N,Doesn't get any better than free either.
N,The first app I install every android phone.
P,This is the best app on the market.
N,6/5.
P,This will be the best app you will install.
N,A must have.
N,Makes the Android keyboard obsolete.
N,It has lots of language... Even Javanese (my region language).
N,"Even it lags a bit, but not a break dealer."
B,It's good freezes though.
N,?.
E,I really enjoy using this app it's fun and quick to use.
N,Exactly.
E,It GA (has) the worst memory and worst intuition ever.
P,Unbelievable.
B,"Like many apps there are bugs, this one has some but its worth!"
E,I love the way it suggest words in my selected languages.
B,"i like the features but my problem is that,  there's no setting in turning on/off pop up letters."
R,it doesn't support multi letters.
P,all in all its great  :)).
N,"Falled in love with it on the very first day I used it, like since 2 years ago."
P,Amazing.
R,"I wish you could also put an auto hide button or feature because my phone only have a 4"" screen and the app takes half of that space."
N,Not too shabby.
P,Love it.
P,Thanks for such a fantastic app.
E,It saves me so much time and is really intelligent at anticipation of my keystrokes.
B,"Good, but sometimes writes the incorrect word after I add space."
N,That really sucks.
N,"Like now I wrote word ""sucks"" added a space and it corrected it to ""sick""."
N,Then I have to go back and edit it.
N,And it happens all the time -.
N,You have all these smart phones but not so smart keyboards.
P,SwiftKey is the perfect answer to keyboard woes especially for people like me with incredibly large fingers.
N,Now I am going to type all the way.
E,The different themes and customisations are really smooth and smart.
N,5 stars from me.
N,Love this product and the fact that you guys always looking to improve more .

P,Looove.
P,Perfect.
N,Go.
P,Excellent application!

E,Absolutely brilliant.
P,Good.
E,Nice keywords with nice colours keyboards?
P,The best.
E,Useful.
E,"Looks a very sleak app and really easy to use - however, I can't download any languages yet, can anyone help?"
N,Obtuvo ko.
P,This is really a great app.
B,"The only problem I've been having is sometimes when typing the active application exits and some other random app opens, it's really weird."
P,Besides that I think this is one of the best keyboards out there.
R,"The one thing it lacks is the ability to *prevent* the text we write in a specific app or website to be sent to the cloud, they use it to improve the quality of the suggestions and such but there should exclusions."
E,Every android users should have this keyboard on their phone... As manufacturers keyboards sucks big time.... Best I love is suggestions... It is as fast as iPhone word suggestions...
E,It has good predictive text.
P,The best app ever!
N,Lanat.

E,But the swipe is kinda slow for me compared to the default Samsung swipe.
P,great keyboard app.
P,Gr8 app.
N,First needs some getting use to.
N,After a while it saves a lot of time and reduces typing errors.
P,Great.
N,Nice app...
P,SwiftKey is the best keyboard app.
N,The must have for every android...
P,Loved it really.
N,Just ?
P,loved it and can't live without this keyboard.....
P,Love.
P,Nice app.
B,"Used to be great but now,  many mistakes, types words multiple times, cannot deal with elipses and changes words to make sentences junk."
N,Uninstalling.
P,Have been using this app since I can remember it's the best everyone should get it.
E,Good app but Vietnamese is not very accurate when using flow.
R,"And I want more options such as character size on keyboard,  change key position etc...."
P,Great app.
E,predictions are also very accurate but sometimes app loads  slow.
N,Cool.

N,Well done.
P,SwiftKey is awesome!!
N,5 stars!!!!!
N,"Letter p does not work on my touch, so this app saved my as from buying a new TouchPad, and it's super sweet with suggestions."
N,Nice.
E,Using my HTC One default keypad for purposes of both English and Polish input is an impossible task.
R,"It is the worst part of this phone,  and with SwiftKey the fix took about a minute,  together with configuration and visual adjustments."
N,All the problems I had with HTC Sense is now gone.
N,This app swiftly recognises used language and adjusts it's corrections seamlessly.
P,The best!
N,The only keyboard I use!
E,And now even better with emoticons and lots of new options!
E,And the basic setup is now free!
E,Way better than stock and gives you many customizable options.
E,Something different from others and awesome theme.
N,"Very pleased to have installed it on my smartphone, would recommend it as a worthwhile addition."
N,I used to love your app back when you had Swiftkey X in 2012.
E,Was very smooth and responsive.
E,"Now this, this is just way too slow and lags the heck out of my typing, I believe its the word prediction which is what I had liked your app for before, but it never lagged like this."
P,Disappointing to use.
N,Unbearable really.
N,Worse in facebook mobile site.
N,Had to go back to stock keyboard.
B,It kept making letters jump ahead of the cursor.
E,Also trying to select text is very difficult.
E,Annoying.
N,Samsung GS4 4.3.
N,Finally they did it.
E,Swiftkey now has a mature and perfect visual design.
N,Along with all the features you need.
R,"Resizing and un-docking the keyboard, Quick way to switch between languages, a few beautifully designed themes,... and the one that I really loved: four-row numpad along with arrow keys!"
P,Good Job!
P,This is a great keyboard.
R,The only thing it needs is a delete entire word for swiping by pressing backspace.
N,This is default on the google keyboards and on Samsung keyboards.
P,Otherwise great.
P,Amazing app... Must for those tired with the outdated android keyboard.
E,Cannot believe how fast it is.
N,It almost reads my mind.
N,Very seldom do I need to tap in more than 2 keys for the next word.
N,The longer I use it the faster it gets.
N,My last update shows that I saved 7000 key strokes.
P,Fantastic.
P,Good.
P,Incredible app I really luv it.
P,Cool.
P,okay everything were great.
R,But is there no Chinese language available???
E,By far the most accurate Android keyboard available.
N,There is no reason not to have swift key as your main keyboard.
N,"Well,  maybe one."
B,When you enter passwords it is like microsurgery since the app changes words and inserts spaces.
E,A small price to pay for the most accurate keyboard on the planet.
P,This app good.
E,Very useful.
E,"The keyboard is very nice and easy to use, plus it learns the words quickly."
B,"Only issue I have is that in Whatsapp, the keyboard lags quite a bit whenever a message is sent."
N,5 stars if this is fixed.
N,Using huawei ascend p6 on kitkat.
P,I absolutely love this app!
P,This is fantastic.....
P,The keyboard itself is perfection .
E,It's easy to navigate and doesn't have a bunch of useless junk buttons right up front.
E,"The auto-correct is just bad, though."
N,It will guess automobile when you wanted egg.
R,"Plus it only has three possible correction options, none of which will ever help you."
P,Still the best keyboard app.
N,If efficiency and effectiveness is your middle name then you need this app!
P,I like it.
R,Can you please add up Chinese language?
P,Great app you have here!
N,Cheers!
E,This keyboard fits my style.
E,I feel like I got much better prediction/correction when this was a paid app (not sure what version that was).
N,"One example: ""5o"" would always get corrected as ""to""."
N,Now that hasn't happened once.
P,best.
P,Just love it.
P,It's the Best keyboard app!
P,Just awesome!
E,Way better then the original keyboard.

P,Its the best keyboard i ve ever used.
N,Great for fat fingers.
E,Great features and customization options.
N,Nothing else to say.
P,Works good not great.
P,love it!!
N,it learns my bad language a made up words.
N,the other swipy keyboards just don't seem to want to learn.
N,This keyboard is not ljki remeber it.
B,It is horrible and rarely corrects or after I type it correctly it replaces it with another word entirely.
N,Like wtf?
N,Plain and simple It's as bad as the stock one.
N,"I've used, recommended, and loved swiftkey for years; bought it before flow even got upgraded."
N,Before now I'd have given it five stars.
B,"But recently it's been lagging my apps, and causing weird keyboard minimizing and opening - randomly."
N,"It's a brand new galaxy s5, not even three weeks old and has no issue with the other installed keyboards."
P,Disappointed in what I considered a quality product.
N,It's really on point for what you want from Swype and it has emojis.
E,The themes are nice too.
R,Why would u not add chinese....or id love it.
N,Stopped using swiftkey and moved to Touchpal X due to terrible lag when typing.
B,"Latest update seems to have fixed that, so happily moved back to Swiftkey!"
E,"Edit: lag present after about a month of use, always about 8-10 words in."
B,Clearing app data seems to temporarily fix the problem.
N,Great time saver.
E,It's so slow D: after I send a message my phone is frozen for the next 5 seconds because the keyboard... I like the auto predict but things need to speed up... Please fix this bug or I'm going back to my phones keyboard!!
R,Just be faster!
N,"Since Android's native keyboard sucks, this is a good alternative."
P,"Quite excellent, really."
N,In return for your personal data.
R,"I mostly swipe, and I've noticed more errors with this swipe platform than other similar input methods, so that gets annoying sometimes."
E,This is saved by the accurate predictability of this keyboard... I find I don't have to swipe as many words if I watch the suggestions.
E,"Voice recognition has proved to be top - notch, as well."
N,Easily 5 stars if swipe worked better.
N,"This app is perfect for those who wish to type quickly, and suffer from few typos in the process."
N,I can't recommend it enough!
N,Ankur gupta.
E,Only problem is slow opening... Good thing is to fast in typing.
N,the only reason i stick to android is this keypad precision....
R,I still dunno why you dun wan to add Chinese lol its been many years I waiting for it.
N,"Many emoji missing and not reload in my tab lite, time to uninstall and find other emoji keyboard, good bye SwiftKey."
N,Sayonara.
E,"It's very nice and easy to use,, when u download it i can assure u,,, u'll gonna love it ?"
E,It offers many options of layout to select as your keyboard.
N,I feel great to type on it as I can resize my keyboard and also match my liking.
E,"Mostly the keyboard works great and I really like the swipe feature, but the skins are pretty limited and look alike."
P,Almost perfect.
P,Wonderful App!
N,"Type with a swipe, it learns and adapts to your style."
P,Love it.
P,The best keyboard ever.
P,Great app.
N,No problems what so ever.
P,Perfect.
P,Lovely.
E,Best keyboard i ever used love that they added emoji support ?
R,Please eliminate the lag.
N,This Keyboard takes a lot of time to pop up.
E,Often the prediction row takes a lot of time to change when the enter key has been hit.
B,The keyboard does freeze very often.
N,It is drawn when it isn't supposed to be.
N,Real nice.
R,Could be optimised as it launches after a second or two.
P,Because is the best app ever.
N,That's why...
P,This is amazing.
R,Perfect but can you make the emoji look like iphone emoji?
R,It will be perfect more??
R,Need Chinese support such as pinyin or changjie.
N,"Also,  I can't see the emoji ."
E,"Overall, it works smoothly and I can type accurately."
N,Thanks for reading this comment.
B,Please fix it as soon as possible.
N,"Using it since a year, flawless and if bugs are found they are solved in a day or two."
P,This keyboard is the best.
P,I did the beta for the emojii regularly and I love it being included in the normal keyboard.
P,Best keyboard app I've ever had.
N,Worth the money.
E,Cool themes!
N,I'm using it right now.
E,I love this app because of its autocorrect.
N,I'm really bad at typing normally but this app fixes that.
N,Really swift !!!
N,"Switched to another keyboard from SwiftKey for a couple days, to try something different."
E,"The other one wasn't user friendly at all, layout was strange."
E,"SwiftKey predictive function is truly amazing and saves a lot of time, keyboard layout makes sense."
B,Someone might be attracted to 'go' to other apps w glitzy themes - but I'd rather have something that functions reliably; and SwiftKey has enough variety of themes to choose from.
N,I'm staying with this keyboard!
P,Best keyboard...
E,Smooth and Easy.
N,"The more you use it, the more convenient it is."
E,Swiping + Accurate predictions are great.
P,I love it.
N,I'm getting very tired of seeing this as a business model.
N,There are not enough apps made for the Android that don't attempt to mine for personal data.
B,"Let's be honest here; loss of control over your personal data is the true cost of a ""free"" app."
N,It doesn't work properly when enabling multiwindow on my device.
N,Unable to type on the top window.
R,"Please, support!"
N,Too bad ?
N,now got a built in swift key.
B,Just lags a bit when selecting emoji's.... Rest works fine!
P,Love it.
P,It's my favourite keyboard at Google Play.
N,Thanks!
N,I get better use of Swype than I do with Swift.
N,"Swift offers a lot, but nothing that I need."
E,"Swiping is much better with Swype, naturally."
N,"I'd image Swift being well-suited for larger screens/tablets/etc, where typing/tapping may be preferred."
E,Very fast for typing.
P,Perfect.
P,Amazing.
N,Wow.
N,Good a lot of improvements in a update.
N,Let's check me.
N,"It has help me alot when I type, better than the stock keyboard, only thing is the update does not let me switch from English to Spanish keyboard."
N,Other than that I am happy customer.
E,"Awesome app, easy and quick to type also comes in great color variations."
N,It failed to work in tecno p5 it had crashed I forced to install.
E,Annoying notification to select a language after selecting one 6 times.
N,"I have just one language installed,  but this keyboard is using 174Mb of RAM."
R,"Also,  it fills up half of the huge screen on my LG G3 without the option to shrink it down while in portrait mode."
E,I like the prediction but the memory usage is out of control.
N,I'm going to switch back to the stock LG keyboard if this memory problem isn't addressed right away.
P,Awsome app.
E,Flawless.
N,Was growing frustrated with my default LG keyboard until I discovered SwiftKey.
E,I love the different varieties of themes.
P,Very good.
P,Samsung S4: This has become the slowest keyboard I have used.
N,I paid for the full version which was great.
E,The major release however has slowed my whole phone down.
N,"despite reloading my Samsung software from scratch, using custom ROMs etc, I have realised there's nothing I can do to speed it up without removing this keyboard."
N,Despite updates there are regular lags.
E,I will rather struggle with the stock keyboard prediction than live with a slow keyboard and phone.
N,I don't have a lot of experience with android as I used iPhone in the last few years.
N,Since a friend introduced me to this keyboard I can't use any other one.
N,Great keyboard with many features even on the free version.
N,Works well I use it on all of my devices.
P,"v good,  I like it."
P,Great app I love it.
N,Good download.
N,Recommend to any one that downloads apps  for free.
N,Works good.
R,I'd love to see the neon theme with neon red accents as well.
N,"My touch screen ""keyboard"" of choice!"
P,the best one yet.
R,I just wish that we had the option of having the classic ios7 emojis!
B,4Starz due to persistent lag.
E,"Predictions 5, layout choices 5, theme 5 corrections 5 language 5."
N,"I keep trying the default keyboards that come with android / Samsung, but I always end up switching back to swift key with swipe system and the learning function,  it makes typing so easy."
B,Takes literally more than 5 seconds for the keyboard to appear after I touch a textbox... WTF.
N,Worked brilliantly on my ANDROID 2.3 now i have an ANDROID 4.2 and it becomes rogue.
N,I've almost had enough....
N,I haven't tried it yet but sounds cool.
N,"Even when I make mistakes while swiping, swift key identifies my word correctly."
E,The keyboard is just brilliant to use specially with hinglish as language.
N,Typing just got fast and more fun.
R,"Customization option as mentioned in the specs above are not available to the fullest, had it been there I would have given 5 stars."
N,It works exactly as expected/promised.
P,The best I've ever seen so far.
N,Everytime I install new ROM or got a new phone this is the one I install first.
P,Best way to customize our keyboard.
E,The inbuilt keyboard is boring.
P,Swift is awesome.
N,Will strictly recommend.
N,This.
E,"I like the way the keyboard is set up,  sometimes though it does not guess my word and I've got to type it and not swipe."
E,"That's annoying,  over all good."
P,Awsome.
P,This keyboard is amazing!
N,"I actually got the full version free on Amazon App store, but still paid for it through play for when i switch phones cause this keyboard is that great."
E,"The predictions are super accurate, the customization is beyond amazing, and the arrows are the best thing since sliced bread."
E,Excellent keyboard but drains battery really fast.
R,Please update it!
P,Best keypad ever.
E,The predictions are just awesome.
P,Very good l love this keyboard.
P,Absolutely love this keyboard.
P,Very good android Keyboard.
E,Very easy and fun to use.
P,"The best I've found, so far......"
P,Nice.
E,Practical.
E,The emotional are updated.
N,There's a Tagalog language that I'm looking for.
R,I hope that you update the emotional if there's a new one.
P,JUST AWESOME?
P,AND I LOVE IT???
E,It's great and a lot better than the standard Android key board.
N,No complaints.
N,Worth a download.
P,Just amazing.
E,Perfect autocorrections and also strong prediction ability.
N,Can definitely predict words in advance.
P,"This is awesome, you can have as many different keypa."
N,cooooool.
E,Auto correct is pretty good.
B,Tho every time I go on to the app it freezes and I can't look at the pay for keyboards ?
R,Gives me functionality across different apps that the standard keyboard cannot deliver.
E,Still exploring the different options but liking it all so far!
P,Love it!
N,"Muy intuitivo, r??pido, est??tico  Recomendado 10000%."
P,"Sucks that I paid for it, but it's a great keyboard app."
E,"Sometimes it thinks it's smarter then you, but features like flow and emoji prediction make it awesome."
R,"I like how SwiftKey works,  and how easy it is to use,  just wish we could get more keyboards for free."
B,Always inserts a wrong word when i press space.
N,Its so annoying.
P,Love it.
E,Auto correct can be annoying but that's with any keyboard these days.
N,It stubbornly refuses to let you type some things no matter how many times you try.
N,It subverts your ability to express yourself which is the antithesis of what a typing app should do.
N,"I don't care how good it may do other things, I can not recommend this app for that simple reason."
N,If you don't like your stock keyboard & wanted a keyboard that can learn the way you type.
N,Just download this you would not regret it at all.
P,"Plus...  the best part was, it's free to download :) +1 for that."
P,Yes it is the best!!!
E,But incredibly good once you get used to it.
E,I usually use at least two languages when chatting and it picks up the difference pretty fast.
E,Predicted words are usually right and the typo correction is very good.
N,Do give this a swing if you have the time.
E,Very useful and easy to use.
P,I love everything about this app.
N,"I don't use Flow, but it's a nice idea."
E,Very intuitive and predicts very well and is fast!
N,Don't read the reviews.
N,Try the app.
N,You will be amazed and You won't return to the stock keyboard.
N,Why does SwiftKey want access to my google+ account?
N,Does every app require all info on its users?
N,"Google is getting ridiculous, no such thing as privacy anymore."
R,Even keyboards need to know your blood type these days.
P,I love my purple keyboard!
E,Thisg app is great at predicting your next txt and I recommend it to anyone wanting a nicer looking keyboard than predownloaded keyboards.
N,The default keyboard on the LG G2 was making so many ridiculous mistakes with my typing.
E,"There is a learning curve because character placements are different,  but SwiftKey remembers and learns and makes my typing far less aggravating."
N,Cool.
P,Best keyboard period.
E,The app is really great for texting and everything else.
B,"But on the HTC One X, it continues to crash even after the update."
N,I'm kinda annoyed by it because it does it twice every day if I'm lucky.
N,Still spend more time correcting then benefiting.
N,No problems.
N,Help a lot to speed up typing!
N,You will be amazed.
P,Great app.
N,I tried the choice out thoroughly.
N,Even the premium ones.
E,"It looks like this one is much better in any category,  in every category."
P,Pretty good.
E,Love everything about it.
E,Awesome prediction engine.
N,My original gripes have been fixed.
P,Good job!
P,Best keyboard available.
N,Resan.
E,"Very smart,  knows what you're gonna say and corrects you!"
P,Super app.
R,Really need voice button more accessible.
N,Ball.
P,Love this app.....
E,Have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling because predictions aren't working.
E,The keyboard and predictive text is fantastic but sadly the emojis don't work on my tablet :(.
N,"Nothing is wrong with this, it works amazingly well."
N,Loved this until I started getting 2xs/day notifications about language updates!
R,There cannot possibly be that many languages in the world!
N,I'm a lazy American!
N,How many do you think I even know?!?
N,One more and Uninstall!!!
P,Love it!
B,"Keep getting an error ""unable to save dynamic language model""."
N,It saves time at the keyboard....
E,"Not as accurate as Swype and once it gets a Word wrong, it's a pain to correct..."
N,I switched from iPhone to the galaxy s5.
P,And I'm loving it.
E,"I love that I can pick different colors,  and it predicts how I type which  my iPhone didn't do so well."
R,"I would very much like to see the symbols page layed out like the alphabet with the number row at the top, and also if you could have an option to not have the suggestions above the keyboard that woukd be awesome too!"
P,So great.
P,Love it.
P,Great!!
N,Saves me quite a few keystrokes.
E,I like how large the space bar is.
E,Easier to type on.
E,ITS SO MUCH SLOW AS COMPARED TO MY STOCK KEYBOARD.....SOMETIMES IT TAKES TAKES SO MUCH TIME TO TYPE A SINGLE WORD.....DON'T ACCEPTING A TOP DEVELOPER APP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS....WORST EXPERIENCE.
E,Autocorrect sucks.
E,This keyboard is worth the price and is way better than almost every other keyboard.
N,The very first app I install on every new Android device.
P,"Wow, having had an iPhone and a Windows phone this is the best keyboard I've ever tried."
P,I like this app but don't love it.
N,Thought it was going to be way better that stock but it isn't..
P,Best keyboard for Android.
N,This is a must-have app.
E,"Its predictions save time, arrow (direction) keys are very useful, and its ability to learn from your usage is outstanding!"
E,Punctuation and special characters and symbols are much easier to use.
R,"Add foreign language support, and you have a very useful app."
P,"I've used Google's and Samsung's keyboards, and this one is hands down the best of the lot."
R,I'd give it a 5 if I can add my own personal words like Google keyboard can.
E,This app was much better when it was paid.
B,Now most of the time there is a delay when hitting the home button.
E,"Themes are good, but I prefer the function I used to have."
N,This keyboard.
N,When ever your in a messaging app like let's say for example viber there's a slight delay right when you press the send button you have to wait half a second before you can type again it's very annoying.
P,Other wise its a good keyboard.
N,Title says it all.
E,Type easy ....
B,When I Finish Typing A text Or Something the Keyboard Stays Up Need To Fix That.
E,Love the predict text.
N,Helps alot but can hinder until it knows ur shorthand.
P,Great app.
N,I went from arround 40 wpm to about 56 to 70 THANK you swiftkeyes.
N,"I got the Note 3,and said I was not going to download anything like a new keyboard, messager, or anything like GO."
N,But I couldn't help it.
P,I love swift.
N,Thanks for it.
N,Ekdum masst.
P,Awesome St.
P,Love it.
E,Nice n easy to use.
P,I love this  app it's better than any other one on the play store.
B,Only thing that sux is every time the phone is reset it goes back to stock keyboard.
R,My only complaint is not having enough customization with color scheme.
P,Other than that this keyboard is amazing.
N,Worth the money.
E,Decent.
N,Thank you developers for every second u spend to develop this keyboard.
N,You really really made a perfect keyboard.
N,SwiftKey has saved my fingers from so much of painful typing.
N,... thank you SwiftKey......
N,Just do it.
P,Good.
E,The tweakability of this app is awesome.
P,I love having the compact keyboard undocked in landscape.
N,Makes things so much easier to see.
E,It seems to respond much faster than Swype too.
R,Can be improved by adding the words which we use and not predicted.
N,Thanks.
E,terms of use agreement and I do not like.
N,This greet.
P,Love this keyboard!!!!
B,"If I want to insert a period at the beginning of a number, to display 0.60 (without the 0) it just puts it at the end of the last word, annoying."
E,"Predictive text poor,  voice to text fair although recently does not ever last spoken word until microphone times out."
E,Auto correct does not seem to 'learn'  as was expected.
P,Quite a disappointment overall.
P,Love??
P,Great Application.
P,Awesome.
E,Love the new themes.
R,Please add more simple emoji like (@_@) etc.
N,On Numara :).
R,Give us more key sounds to choose from.
E,"Way more accurate than Swype, Samsung stock,  or the Google keyboard."
E,Very slick interface.
N,I'm still stoked that it was free when I downloaded it.
N,I might have even shelled out the 5$ for it.
N,"If you type a lot on your phone, it's well worth the money."
N,Nice app.
P,Best keyboard out!
N,Loved it when it was a paid app.
E,Now it has constant updates and is buggy and annoying.
N,"I spend more time fighting its ""corrections"" more than anything."
E,The emoji feature is annoying and usesless.
N,"I'm an adult, I don't type emotes like a teenage girl."
P,Excellent....
E,"All over it has a sleek eye appealing design and look,  it is nice and spaced and yet has so much,  I love it and would recommend this to anyone and everyone."
P,Awesome keyboard.
E,Great predictions.
N,Been using this for about an year now.
R,Would be great if you could add emoticons like in the touchpal x keyboard.
R,add lg one keywords  features.
P,I love this keyboard app.
E,So easy to use!
N,"Plus, It has Tagalog language installed."
P,Excellent....
N,"Currently using Swype keyboard, it has Chinese language supported."
R,Good app but please add Gurmukhi language in this app....
E,"So far i like it, especially the comma having its own button but 'i' not changing to I automatically is annoying."
R,Also the emojis are easier to identify in colour than black and white if they could be changed please.
E,Love the emoji predictions and quick learning of new words.
B,Some symbols of Samsung keyboard missing.
E,"The prediction success rate, ease of use, cloud sync and customisation options with 3 simultaneous languages that can be used are absolutely unmatched and something that makes this product first class."
E,Also the development rate support is unrivalled.
N,Thank you!
E,If it didn't replace actual words with predicted words.
E,Replacing a real word is really annoying.
P,I like this app bcos its way to do typ is very good n new.
E,It's very useful.
E,But the word predictions are way off.
P,Best keyboard and It's free.
P,Awesome experiance.
R,Add hand writing facility.
P,Great.
B,Updated language packs failing to install.
R,Please sort out.
N,All sorted thanks Developer.
P,Very good  APP.
N,Nice.
P,Great app best of all.
E,I like that it suggests emojis based on the words I type.
E,It's easy to use and bright colors are fun.
N,HTC Desire 816.
P,Very good software.
E,Over its a good keyboard but font size of predictions are very large & there is no any option to reduce its size.
E,"That much large size looks weird, there must has an option to change the font size, as in its previous paid version the font size was small & looks reasonable."
N,Nice app.
N,Thumbs-up.
N,Can't live without it.
E,Very smart predictions.
B,"The dictionary saves incorrect words without asking me, Google keyboard always asks when I touch a word prediction that isn't in the dictionary."
E,The keyboard also corrects words that are spelled correctly.
R,"There is no configurable auto-correction setting, basically just on or off."
N,"If a word was corrected and I go back to un-correct it, it just corrects it again."
B,"Flow predicts things wrong frequently, sometimes picking words that aren't even words."
E,The themes are nice but the keyboard is just not on par.
N,N?o sei se ?? por causa do aparelho mas o bot?o de emotions fica no lugar do enter...  isso atrapalha... Quando escreve uma palavra errado preciso apagar letra por letra.
E,Super fast Super smooth Super Cool!
R,No Chinese  ???
B,It is a great keyboard that I always use it but when using swift key with WPS office in excel files when I write the first characters and choosing the word it add it without auto correct misspelled like love will be lolove.
N,"Best keyboard for my HTC one,  no doubt beats the factory keyboard."
P,Best at all.
P,This has been a great keyboard and is working brilliantly now as I type.
N,Unfortunately when I use it for email on my HTC it keeps ignoring spaces joining words and generally getting into a mess.
N,Did not have this problem before.
P,One of best keyboard language app.
N,Prediction.
N,Saves times.
P,The best keyboard I've seen by far for my smartphone!
N,Just hit install and see for yourself...
P,Best keyboard.
P,Superb.
P,Best keyboard I've used so far.
E,"i just hate how it occuppies space,  and makes editing a word useless."
R,"it also put spaces where it shouldn't. spams the notification with ""unable to save dynamic language model"" last update gets me from 16MB to 25MB are you nuts,  facebook also wants aditional 13mb with its messenger,  are you all developers nuts."
N,go optimize your apps.
N,Compared to Google stock keyboard I find swiftkey very laggy and slow.
R,I like it better and would use it if not for the lag.
E,Excellent keyboard for typing... Easy to use it.
N,It really takes input very swiftly.
N,"As someone who resisted moving to a touchscreen, this has made it much easier!"
N,It is a great app for ease of typing with one hand or two.
E,Good range of themes to suit one's preference.
R,Will be great if Chinese input is included.
N,"""rate SwiftKey if you think is great."
P,""" It IS indeed great."
N,I've got nothing more to say.
N,First time i using it.
N,I don't understand why the emoji's end up different when you send a message.
N,"One example is when I choose the little disco dancing guy, he ends up being a female Hawaiian hula dancer when I send the message."
R,"Maybe it's just me, but I think they should all represent exactly what they'll look like to the person you're sending a message to."
B,I keep getting confused responses to my messages....
P,Excellent app.
N,Saves so much time!
R,Please add possibility to transfer application to SD.
N,Not bad.
P,Amazing!
N,Have been using swift key for a long time.
P,Love.
N,"I know this is one of the best, but how much space does it take?"
B,I have 70 MB free and it says not enough space.
N,"Help, i realy want it."
N,This keyboard ?
E,easily adipts the way u type and irs suggestions are also perfect its is just great.
N,This one is a must if you like efficient technologies.
N,the emoji always come up and I never use it.
R,Give me back the old interface.
R,I'll give you five stars if you add Japanese.
E,"Super easy, love how it predicts the next word, and allows you to go back and correct typos."
N,You save so much time with Swift text.
P,Great app.
N,"I like the keyboard, it makes my messages much more professional."
R,"I am tired of seeing a ""updated language packs are available"" SwiftKey notification."
R,"I'd also like to be able to clear the notification ""Choose input method -  SwiftKey-SwiftKey""."
N,Works just great on my Samsung Galaxy Grand Neo.
N,Thanks.
N,Nice app...
N,Now I can type faster without worrying.
E,Backup predictions and trend phrases sync really makes difference.
N,Most keyboards on the droid that I've had so far have been clunky and difficult to use.
E,This one is very easy for me to text with as well as make corrections when I misspelled something.
P,Been using on my tab it has an awesome flow just love that and its rezising feature.
P,Awesome.
N,Evryone else said it... But reason make me give 4 stars is.
E,I just dont like the theme.
N,There are premium theme.
E,But too expensive Sorry.
E,My phone came with swype installed and it was terrible.
N,SwiftKey remembers all of my favorite words.
P,Very good.
N,This is the only reason you need to leave iOS.
N,It's everything I need for a App.
N,I'm sure they will offer even more Emoji in the Future.
E,Precise and accurate.
N,100x better then old keyboard!
E,Soooo easy-to-use.
E,Only negative is the emotions aren't in color.
E,Spotlight Blue skin is really awesome!
N,Just what I was looking for!
P,After the Google keyboard started giving errors I used this and it's just awesome.
R,Wish they made the L style themes for free tho.
N,Install and inform the global communities that it is  truly great and wonderful so don't waste time just go for it.
R,Hopefully the notifications asking for me to rate this app will stop now.
P,Love it!!
P,Thank you for making the best keyboard app for android totally free.
E,Swiftkey is amazingly accurate.
E,This app was functionally impressive and gorgeous.
R,"The addition of emojis is fine, as I understand you need to appeal to all users, not just adults, but there ABSOLUTELY NEEDS to be a function to DISABLE EMOJIS ENTIRELY."
N,I am not the only one that has suggested this and even under the longpress function the emojis are still activated at times and causes a hysteria in even up to date phones such as GS4Active.
R,Please add a setting to disable emojis entirely.
N,Thank you kindly.
N,A loyal SwiftKey user.
P,This app is amazing the keyboard and themes... Awesome.
N,It types Hinglish or even understands when spoken.
N,I couldn't believe it.
N,Thanks for such a beautiful app.
E,Much more better than others.
E,"Cool features, makes the keyboard just as good as an iPhone."
P,Such a good app.
E,People on blackberry can see the emojis and I love I can customize it.
R,I'm disappointed that there is now way to insert custom abbreviations.
N,"Such as I type ""jk"" and just kidding is entered."
P,I love this feature in iOS.
E,"Otherwise,  the themes are quite pricey at a buck each."
E,"Otherwise I seem to really like the keyboard,  and think that it has much better predictions than the stock keyboards."
P,cool.
P,Amazing keyboard app.
P,This is a great keyboard!
E,It's convenient and its Not annoying as some keyboards.
N,First thing I download on a new phone.
N,I was hating my phone keyboard and am so happy with this one.
P,Besht app....
E,So much better than HTC sense.
P,The Best.
B,"Sorry to bother you guys,, I have switch to S4, but then Why cant i update the Indonesian language... Can u fix it?"
B,"On some apps the keyboard just won't pop up when I click in a text box, there's been an update since it first started happening and they still haven't fixed it."
N,"It's good, i have it on all 8 of my devices."
P,Excellent work!!
B,The app worked awesome for 14days max and then when I try to change the input colour it comes on main screen pls fix this bug.
E,Incredible typing speed.
E,It's got such wonderful prediction very well tailored to my swiping style.
E,Sometimes it will give very strange predictions but usually it's spot on.
B,Error 941.
E,I like the multilingual support but it's a little slow and doesn't allow quick switch to other keyboards.
N,I have to use the notification bar to switch.
E,"Nice app , need help how to turn off the auto correction feature ."
P,Great keyboard.
N,"For me, using SwiftKey is the best way to input text on a phone."
N,I used an iPhone for 5 years and could never type correctly on its keyboard.
P,"This should be one of the standard keyboards, it's fantastic!"
N,"Bought this a long time ago on a flash sale, and switched to it when Swype stopped being free."
E,Swift key is nowhere near as good at getting the words correct.
N,So I've paid for Swype.
N,"And as I type this,I don't regret it one bit."
N,Ossom.
N,"One word, SMART."
N,After trying it.
P,I think its the best hand down.
N,Nejlep??? aplikace!!
E,The keyboard looks great.
E,I can't get passed the horrible prediction and grammatical errors.
N,Uninstalled.
E,I like the fact I get to change my keyboard with out any problems or buying them....  Neon is my favorite one...  Thank you for making it easy.
P,Very annoying.
N,Cea mai buna!
B,Unable to download English uk.
P,"Always loved Swift Key, easily the best keyboard on android just ahead of AOSP."
N,Has become very laggy for the last few months on all my devices even freshly factory resetted.
P,Really great.
E,I love the new themes.
R,One request: sports themes!
R,I'd love to be able buy themes for my favorites teams.
B,Even of you didn't have the logo but just color schemes for NFL and MLS teams.
N,Joyful typing exprience.
N,on galaxy s5.
N,Nice app....
P,TOOOOOOOO good enjoying IT.
E,Swype is nice s well as the ability to customize endlessly however it makes to many typos.
P,It's okay.
P,Cool.
P,I love to use this app.
E,Best autocorrect hands down.
N,Memorizes how I write to the point I can usually avoid typing out most words.
N,Well worth the price for pro.
N,Absolutely world class application.
N,Hatts off.
E,"Excellent app, the predictions are very good."
P,I love it.
N,So swyft.
N,And it holds the Key!
P,Superb application.
N,Would never use a different keyboard.
P,Simply the best keyboard around.
N,Worth the couple of quid I paid.
N,Really helps me.
P,This keyboard app is fantastic.
E,I was experiencing so much lag with other keyboard apps and I find the buttons on the stock android keyboard too small.
E,My typing is so much faster and accurate.
N,I haven't even messed with most of the great features and settings yet.
P,Love it.
P,The best keyboard.
N,Not bad.
N,Great app for people who want to slide instead of type.
N,I was experiencing issues with swype and tried this again and it works great for me.
E,"I like the emoji support too, that's the main reason I chose this app."
P,Awesome.
B,Unable to save dynamic language model error.
N,All time favorite Android app period.
P,Best app in it's class.
E,It is great and easy.
E,"Highly accurate, intuitive and customizable."
E,"I love the fact that it ""learns"" your writing style as you type."
N,Much preferred over my phone's stock keyboard.
E,Great useful app.
N,"After the last update, it autocorrects things that aren't wrong."
N,It's very frustrating to have to double check after something that's supposed to make your life easier.
N,"I loved it before but now, it's more work than its worth."
N,Delayed keyboard response.
E,App has become unpredictable.
E,Word predictions way off.
N,Paid version.
N,How can I get a refund.
E,Amazingly accurate in both typing and voice recognition.
E,Much better than the keyboard I was previously using.
P,Best keyboard in Android.
N,adapts to the user.
E,Like the icon and the way it types.
P,Love it.
R,I wish android got colored emojis tho.
P,A great app.
E,Much better than the Android standard keyboard.
N,Some very good points but irritating in inserting wrong words.
N,"Using English (US), Spanish (US), and Norwegian, this keyboard performs very well on my LG G2 (technically and usability-wise, better than any other) in using all three interchangeably."
E,Customization support is phenomenal as well.
R,"I would, however, like to see the ability to switch to other keyboards by a keypress, as I need to switch to Mandarin and Japanese keyboards often as well."
P,Nice work.
R,Color the emoji.
R,"Only thing I wish it did was have an easier way of confirming, yes I spell some words weird."
N,"But after a few times of entering my last name, it seems to have gotten the idea :)."
N,A little over zealous with notifications imo but still a solid app and worth the the install.
P,I love it......
N,This app is truly awesome it seems to know what you are going to type before you type it.
E,I can type soo fast now and not worry because the auto correct seems to almost always get it right.
N,WOW!!
P,Great job guys!!!
P,Great!
P,Really great!
P,"No,  really great!"
E,Awesome predictions and  corrections (bilingual).
R,I just hope they ae not mining all my typing habits (and words) for evil porpoises.
N,WHEN I AM IN HANGOUTS AND PRESS THE HOME BUTTON THE KEYBOARD STAYS UP.
B,PLEASE FIX.
B,Sometimes the keyboard is slow to pull up when a text box is clicked.
R,I chose this keyboard specifically because I can have to option to have the enter button be the default instead of the emoji button.
E,I love the fact that this keyboard remembers how you talk and literally predicts your words.
E,I love the different keyboard layouts and colors you can choose.
B,The only thing I don't like is there's not enough free colors to choose from.
N,"If there's more added , then I will give 5 stars!"
N,Just switched phones and realized how much I appreciate this app.
N,"Easy to use, saves keystrokes."
R,Would not be without it!
N,Genial.
P,great app.
E,Great and very fast!!!!
P,Best keyboard everrrrrrr!
N,Ultimate  experience....
E,The swype action is replacing my words with nonsensical gibberish.
N,It's getting better the more words it learns & I keep finding ways to get around it's nonsense.
N,"For now, it's still slower than using my original keyboard with Swype."
N,Hoping it will get faster as it learns.
E,But I do enjoy being able to use emoticons.
N,??
B,IT should be the default and built in app for every phone.
P,Love this application A+ in my book.
E,I send alot of texts regularly that are the same  and this app virtually writes the whole thing including any variations text to text.
P,I absolutely love this app.
R,Please add some traditional ?
N,'s.
N,It knows what I'm going to say next!
N,"I've tried every other keyboard for my Android and I miss my iPhone keyboard so much,  until I downloaded this one."
P,It's amazing.
B,"No mistakes like the last one I downloaded,  no need to go back a million times to fix everything."
N,It learns from my typing too!
P,Simple and awesome!
N,Finally!
N,Thank you thank you thank you!
P,I really love this keyboard I have been using it for about 3 years now.
N,I use it on my note 3 and note 10.1 2014 edition.
N,"Only feature that's missing (or I just can't find it) is the ""tab""  key function."
E,"I use my tablets to create word docs on office suite pro, and I need the ""tab""  key to indent."
R,"Please add this in with the next update, for now I will have to use another keyboard every time I need the ""tab""  key."
N,Keep up the good work!
N,Works well and gives the keyboard flare and spunk.
N,The keyboard stays open on my lock screen.
N,This makes drawing a security pattern nearly impossible.
B,Please fix!
P,It's the closest thing to a true intelligent keyboard I've found.
N,"It just works ;)  There's just one problem for the recent versions : slow reaction in changes ( end of a typing,  keyboard closing....)."
N,Even works on my old HTC vx.
E,"Suddenly all my personal predictions stopped working and SwiftKey doesn't predict any of my old personal words (English ) , only regular English words are predicted."
N,May be this happened after an update or something I'm not sure but I'm sure that I didn't touch anything on the app.
R,"Please bring my personal words back again and make my life as easy as you did before, I don't want to retype each single word again."
E,Also I feel like current predictions are not as smart as it was before.
N,Nice to be able to have the same key pad for each phone.
N,New phone just re-download and install.
E,The cloud also allows you to keep your typing style and word predictions after you create and account and log in.
N,Really like all the features.
N,"It has swipe mode but I just can't get used to to that, need to more than practice with it."
P,Best keyboard hands down!
E,"Great app, easy to set up and use, and never an incorrect phrase."
P,Love it!
E,I love the keyboard options and how responsive the keyboard is but the flow isn't great.
N,Swype works much better.
E,"Some words like  ""it's"" and other contractions are almost impossible to flow."
E,"If they can make the flow more accurate especially with two letter words and words like ""too"" I'll give it five stars."
R,An easier way to add apostrophes would be amazing too.
N,Swype still has the edge in that department.
N,Some fun keyboards.
E,"I don't see much of a difference in word predictions, there is only a few  themes to choose from."

R,Great keyboard and even better with emojis support!
P,I love this keyboard!
E,Excellent emoticons!
R,Wonderful color themes for the keyboard itself as well!
N,Thanks so much SwiftKey!
P,Pretty awesome keyboard.
N,I have downloaded it for every new phone.
N,"I payed for it back then, but all of you new users get it free."
N,Sweetness!
P,Amazing.
N,Nice app.
N,This app is holy.
B,Still too slow to load when changing text fields (over 2s!!)
N,and to unload: after I press home I have to wait the same 2/3 secs for it to go away which is a lifetime!
N,Used the paid version for years.
N,Can't find a thing wrong with it.
P,"A great app, and it keeps getting better."
N,(tab 3.8) Now on Tab S. Even better.
N,Saves you a huge amount of typing.
N,Keyboard.
N,"So good, it makes me lazy."
P,Kool I like it.
E,"I love the way it predicts without replacing the word until I actually press the word, and I love the choices of keyboards."
N,Fun colors.
N,Loved it all then it started putting double same words in my text!
N,"Today, I tried keeping a single (unusual 3 letter name for a person on Facebook) word intact along with an explanation point."
R,"it would NOT allow me to do so, AT ALL!"
N,Either this gets resolved or I will definitely move on!
E,Too frustrating and very non productive!!!
N,HELP!?!!
N,"I don't know how I lasted so long with the default Samsung keyboard... This is a truly excellent keyboard, whether you swipe or type normally."
N,Highly recommended.
N,This is a great keyboard but it's missing traditional Chinese and simply Chinese... Will give five stars if you added it.....
R,still slow & still missing some emojis!
N,Works great.
P,Best keyboard app ever.
N,It is doing a great job of learning what I type.
N,It's almost  like it knows what I want to say before I type it.
N,It kept asking me to rate it so here is my rating.
E,"I was really mesmerized when I saw the types of keyboard themes it consisted, but was highly dissapointed when I came to know the fact that it word predictions can't be stopped."
N,"It completely ruined my experience and forced me to uninstall it, despite there were no other glitches."
N,A must for all my devices.
R,... to have a full keyboard configuration for tablets on landscape.
N,"As all programmers, there are some important keys that I need like the TAB, CTRL, ALT and numeric keyboard on the same layout, just like a physical PC keyboard."
N,Is it on your plan to implement something like this?
N,I've  always used Google or Samsung but swift key is very nice.
N,Miss my number row though.
P,I love this!
E,It helps you with speed and accuracy!
N,Nigga this app is the shiznit.
P,I love this keyboard.
E,I love how customizable it is and how well it works on my galaxy s4.
R,"I only wish that you could add more characters,  like how on the stock Samsung keyboard there are the symbols for all the card suits."
R,I also wish you could design your own keyboard layout instead of only preset options.
N,I really do live this keyboard but a lot of time at the start of a type it freezes up.
N,Then it makes you wait as it pain staking slowly places each letter.
N,After those first few words though it texts like a dream.
R,Just wish it didn't freeze like that.
E,Also where is that emote prediction it promises?
P,Great keyboard very responsive.
R,"What I think they should improve is the option to add customized emails, like @whatever."
N,I love the new update with the swype  like feature...  I dare say is even better than swype  that's the only reason I came back.
R,5 starts because they added emoji!!
P,Love this app.
N,Works great.
N,"Can't see what I type, and I have to type a few words click back space then check on the words???"
R,"I'd like to be able to press enter simply, to change lines, without smiley faces showing up half the time."
E,"And I feel it doesn't ""guess"" the correct word as well as swype does."
B,The fact that I don't have to change between languages (it recognizes if I'm writing French or English  because I installed both dictionaries) is a huge plus!
N,"After using this for few months, it started giving me problems."
B,US english selected downloaded multiple times then again it ask me to set up language.... Developers any help??
P,Great keyboard.
R,Would love to see you guys implement the use of emojis my nexus 7 has them on the Google keyboard on 4.4.
N,Also make them to be used on all apps.
P,I love your keyboard on my sgs4 just want my emojis the???
P,edit: greatest keyboard evar.

N,I recommend this keyboard to everyone!
P,This app is amazing.
B,One of the Best keyboard of all time but when I'm ready to text the keyboard takes a long time to show up.
P,I really like this.
E,"The fact that 'learns ""is amazing and sometimes a little scary (or occasionally funny) ."
E,The different keyboard layouts are also a plus.
N,I would definitely recommend this app.
N,Its good.
P,The best keyboard for Android.
P,Great app in every way.
E,Easy to use.
N,Works great for me ??????
N,Still a few mistakes.
P,Best app I ever bought.
N,The app really slows down the typing process.
P,"Other than that, great app."
P,Really great app.
E,Although the keyboard loads a little slow.
P,Love It.
P,Best app ever.
N,I no have emoji......
P,Great job with the app guys.
N,Osm app.
P,Good.
E,"SwiftKey has more intuitive punctuation control, better word prediction and runs smoother than the phone's stock keyboard."
P,I really love this app.
E,The colors are wonderful also!!!
E,Slow responding.
R,There's no mandarin language available.
R,"Please add in mandarin language,  then it will be perfect!"
P,Great app.
N,For me with my one eye and shaky hands it is just wonderful.
N,Just the in the Market.
E,Its anticipation is top notch and the display is very clear.
N,The heading says it all.
N,Had paid for this app before it went free but it was totally worth it!
P,Just point blank love it.
P,"Was a great keyboard,  I still use it,  but it's not as good as it used to be."
B,"I have a HTC one m7,  and the swype function works great,  but when I just type regularly,  it lags alot and it could get really annoying,  other than that though it's a great app,  I told my wife to get it and on her phone it works amazing,  it's just the HTC one I guess,  fix it and I'll rate 5 star."
P,Great.
E,But they have every other button color theme but red!
N,For real?
N,Its getting better time to time.
N,Nice keyboard.
P,Fantastic.
N,Want Gujarati and Hindi fonts.
P,Great alternative keyboard!
R,This is my favourite keyboard but I really need to transfer it to my sd card because I'm running low on my internal storage; considering that it is a large app.
B,"Please, i really need to move my files to my sd card because my phone defaulty sends my downloads to my internal storage but i can't download anymore cause Im running out of internal memory!"
R,"please oh please make it acceptable to move to the sd card, It's a really great keyboard and I don't want to uninstall it just to save space!"
N,Make swept left on entry field to delete words n right to undo.
N,Gets most weird (words) wrong.
E,"Keeps trying to correct words like; penis, vagina, masturbate, and sex... Why?"
N,"I tooling (type) in words like ""composed"" and instead get ""connoisseur"", a word I never use."
N,"It will even use made up words like ""bassi"" instead of ""basis"", along with other bizarre words in place of common words that would be the obvious choice based on the sentence."
N,Why would it do that?
E,No lag and amazing themes.
P,Love it.
N,"I have used this app for over a year, but now it's time to try something new."
N,Constantly gets words wrong.
N,Tries to correct words with no mistakes.
N,I thought this app memorized your text patterns?
N,Swift is always off.
N,I have to always correct the apps mistakes for words.
N,Deleted.
R,"Good one... I've stopped using all other applications, it would be better even more if you add Indian languages like Kannada...."
E,Very accurate prediction and no switching back and forth between languages.
N,Nice.
P,Awesome.
R,"There's only a few things I can ask, the option for delete account doesn't work anymore, maybe a translucent theme, I don't know if that's possible in Android, definitely it needs an Android l theme, and if you can add more sounds to choose it would be awesome."
N,"For the actual app, everything works perfect."
N,"I always like Swiftkey I bought it in every account I create, both phone and tablet version everytime when it was a paid app and I regret nothing."
P,Great ever.
P,Superb tool :-).
N,Add Nepali language and I will give u 5 ?
N,I can see room for improvement.
E,Like when I use it with Skype the emotion icons are not readable.
N,Also no ability to use voice.
N,Addition of voice is necessary for drivers using there phones.
P,Best keyboard app I've used so far!
R,Also I really wish to be able to turn off suggestions.
P,Brilliant app.
E,It really annoys me that you can't turn off next word prediction.
B,"I love that it offers suggestions for the current word, but I'd rather have various forms of punctuation up there or even just nothing at all."
R,"Also it should have a user dictionary so I can input the words I use that the keyboard won't recognize, like curse words."
N,Its such a wonderful app... Keep it up!!!
N,Cuba dulu bru tau...
N,no....clipboard......
P,Best keyboard ever.
N,the only Android app one must have...awesome experience with its continuous input....
N,Brilliance!
P,Love the app.
N,What I love most is that you can write in 2 languages without switching a button or something.
N,Nice app.
P,It is not just awesome but also a great time saver!
N,Happy to use it!Keep it up!
N,:-).
E,"Good, except one thing: let us decide where to have predictions."
E,I don't like predictions in browsers omnibox and Google search omnibox.
N,No picture emojis?

N,Ultimate application.
E,Excellent accuracy.

P,This is a good keyboard.
E,But where is the option to hide the prediction bar?
E,Not everyone need the prediction bar.
E,And how turn off auto spacing function?
R,Make it show up and dissappear faster.
E,how to disable the auto correction.
N,Can't see the emoji in any app.
B,People only see the emoji as Chinese words pls fix then I'll rate it five star ?
P,Best keyboard replacement.
P,The best app for any android user!
E,Best keyboard with so good hinglish words prediction n fast enough to stick wid it.
N,The user interface for the keyboard is fantastic.
N,I was using a different one before and it wasn't nearly as responsive as this one is.
N,It also required a ton of unnecessary permissions where this one requires none.
N,Overall I'm very happy with it so far.
N,I highly recommend checking it out.
N,The app does a much better job of anticipating the words I want to say.
N,I typically type about half of each word.
E,Time saving and looks great.
N,Mantap.
R,Why change the Return key for emoji?
P,This is the best keyboard I've used.
P,Awesome.
B,"At first I just endured it, but it crawled under my skin and takes a very long time to even start up."
N,UNINSTALL.
P,Its reaily awesome gud one.
P,:)  loved it.
R,"This is a great keybaord, but I hope you make ""Predictions""  optional where I don't need it."
N,Also I hope you add some characters that are used in Arabic character above the letters (example: ?
N,?   )
R,I cant see the emoji :-(.
P,Have used all the other keyboards including swype and this one is the best.
E,becomes laggy.
N,Its free now.
N,"funciona perfecto, incluso mejor que el nativo de android ICS en Xperia E   recomendarle, me gusta  tener 2 o m??s diccionarios para escribir en varios idiomas."
N,Are abhi to party shuru hui hai tere chapal sandal jute baag sir se pao kr to swag.
E,"Awesome predictions even in Spanish,  great buy."
N,Has a very good power to guess the word's !!
N,Nice app.
P,Awesome.
N,Not bad.
N,Like it better than the other ones.
N,Aug 28: no new updates since July.
N,July 28: Two updates occurred since last report & still locks up & not useable.
N,July 14: app locks up aft sys update & not useable.
E,When it was working: it was easy to use and sig better than default keyboard.
R,"Some symbols eg ""backward slash"" not easy to find."
B,Phone reverts back to Samsung keyboard when rebooted even though it is default keyboard.
N,Not perfect but better than default keyboard.
N,Trial version gives lots of time to test features.
R,Need tamil language.
N,Used it on the G3 and nexus Galaxy.
N,Much better than the stock keyboard.
E,And it has nice colored themes.
N,Nice keyword.
E,Very pretty and smart.
N,Live it.
N,The more you use it the better it becomes.
N,Give color to the emoji keyboard.
E,I confuse with the emotions sometimes.

R,Chinese please :(.
N,Like all the options.
N,Would  recommend!
P,Love this app.
P,"Great features and such a better layout, I love it."
N,Woww nice app keep it up thank youuu.
P,I have tried many keyboards but this is far ahead of the rest.
R,I really like this app but I need to type Chinese everyday and there's no Chinese support in this great app ??
N,"Works great everywhere except in Touchdown email app, which I use as primary form of communication daily."
N,SwiftKey lags so severely inside Touchdown that it's completely unusable.
B,Please fix!!!
N,Have already emailed support and told no fix coming anytime soon....
N,I like this app and I don't have to download the apps for keyboards.
P,This replacement keyboard is by far the best I've tried since I started using android.
N,But Where is Bengali language?
P,Very good.
E,This app is amazing I like the bilingual setting makes things so much easier.
E,Since I like sending messages to my family in spanglish lol...
N,Very NICE.
B,The keyboard has been locking up real bad lately  please fix with update.
N,An excellent option for people using more than one language regularly.
E,Best predictive text I've  ever encountered and flows seamlessly between languages as well.

N,Might try again.
P,One of the best apps I've  ever downloaded.
B,"One minus, the keyboard sometimes doesn't close when it should but it's  such a minor problem I wouldn't let it count against it."
P,This app is a good replacement for the default keyboards.
N,"In addition, the swipe feature on the keyboard is good but my battery life drains too quick."
P,Great.
N,Very useful.
P,Brilliant.
N,Err:509
N,doesn't  save passwords though.
N,Nice app.
E,Easy to use.

N,Absolutely amazing how it keeps track of your typing patterns.
N,The way it learns you is amazing.
P,Good.
P,Excellent application.

N,I use it on my phone and tablet.
E,Very fast and reliable.
E,Easy to customize and set up.
P,Love it.
N,"I really wanted to hate it,  but it works great."
N,5 stars!
N,gooooood.
E,Love the fact that I can alternate  between 2 languages and it predicts in  both reasonably well.
N,Mangler international tastatur.
P,Really like it.
R,Would give a 5 if only i can modify the sounds upon typing.
N,And if it doesn't freezes often.
N,Foarte faina.
E,There are not enough extra features in this app to overcome the frustration of not automatically capitalization of the letter I in the English pak.
N,Staying with the default keyboard.
N,At least is has the algorithm to do the I..
N,Very helpful.
N,I wish I had discovered this keyboard sooner.
N,I use it on my HTC One M8 and my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.
N,I have carpel tunnel in both hands and tendinitis in my left thumb (and I'm left-handed) so being able to use a stylus and swype features are important to me.
E,"I also love that, on my phone, I was able to match my keyboard to my messaging background."
N,"If you're looking for an awesome keyboard, look no further!!!"
N,A must for your phone.
N,After it learns all your sentence trends and gramatic habits it makes typing and texting so much quicker.
E,It looks good on top of it since it is so customizable.
N,Bravo!
N,Works like it should.
R,Please allow more than 3 languages at the same time!
N,Where is the paid version?
N,"I bought the old version some time ago, I hope you are not willing to make us pay for it once more."
N,But slow at opening.
P,I love this keyboard!!!
R,The new update is awesome.
N,Thank you.
R,I love the new theme store and the idea of the emojies.
N,I keep trying to use the emojies and they won't work.
N,If I send just a happy face they get a blank text.
B,Please fix this.
N,Also I used to be able to send my messages by hitting the arrow key which is now the emojie key.
R,I would love to be able to do that again.
N,Thank you for a great app.
P,Best mobile keyboard available!
N,But how do you turn off the app to use the original keyboard.

N,Including credit card information.
N,Is keybord ki chut maaru maima.
E,"Greatly improved my accuracy, can't wait for iPad version."
P,Simply awesome.
R,Just needs a front delete key & it will be just fantastic.
P,Still love it though.
R,Please try add a front delete key so we don't have to use only the back delete key.
P,Awesome still.
R,Hope there will be Chinese language in pinyin soon.
B,"It's OK if you like themes and personalizations, but the fact that had a non standard keyboard alignment, makes me confused some times, while I don't understand the logic... Why so difficult to write a '?"
N,'....
R,But needs to give custom options as well.
N,Much better than most default keypads.
P,Hands down the best keyboard for Android.

N,It works great.
P,I love it.
E,"The themes are great,  too."

E,how can disable this prediction?
N,Can't text without it!!
P,Great app!
N,Makes texting so much faster!
N,Nas?l bu kadar d??zg??n tahmin edebiliyor o kadar yanl??
N,yazarken.
N,ahane.
E,"It does everything, and is free."
P,Love it :D.
B,"It'd be better if the space is spaced AFTER typing another word, less annoying when logging in too."
E,There are duplicate words occasionally when auto-correcting.
R,"Furthermore, still no Chinese language?"
R,"Suggestion: in addition to themes, how about let us customize the flow trails too?"
P,That'd be awesome!
P,It's an excellent keyboard.
R,But the problem is there's no Bengali language.please add Bengali and I shall give u 5 stars.
N,This typing application is just perfect.
E,I love the ability to learn about your text input and is it is visually well presented.
N,"Thumbs up after the last update, it is now faster than ever :)."
N,Makes typing so much quicker &  more efficient.
N,Really intelligent how it understands & corrects what you type.
N,Easy 5 stars.
N,Well done to the developers!
N,**Update** 28/08/14- I've had this keyboard since the S3 & now i have the Htc One M8 & I'm back to Swiftkey.Aslong as it keeps improving I'll always use it.
P,This keyboard replacement is great.
R,It should be a default keyboard option for all devices.
P,Good.
E,Good ui and easy to use.
E,Auto correct is awful.
P,Awesome.
P,I love it!
N,Been using Swift key since I got an Android device and still using it and will use it.
E,Very accurate and awesome keyboard!
P,Awesome....
P,Super.
N,1
N,Arabic letters are not in the right order.
B,Some letters are not in the right places.
N,2
E,"There are some automatic corrections that I dont want, for example spacing after a comma."
N,It's very annoying.
N,3
E,why can't I disable the predictions?
E,"(the ones at the top of the keyboard), I don't use arabic prediction while I do use english prediction."
R,If I could disable one and keep the other it would be great.
N,Once these are fixed I will give you your 5 stars.
N,Ps.
N,I couldn't find the developer's email anywhere.
P,"Superb app..... Smooth, velvety like."
P,Great keyboard app.
E,Excellent Very Helpfull.
E,pls have 'disable auto correction' option.
E,this feature is annoying me and slow me down.
N,"The keyboard is very good,  but I can't see emojis :(."
N,I've been using this app for at least 2-3 years with different Android phones and tablets!
R,"I have a suggestion : please give us more choices for your keyboard, colors, styles, etc!"
E,"Problems are minimal, word suggestions and corrections are are good, and the keyboard operation is very smooth."
P,Great program.
N,You won't be disappointed.
N,Rad!
N,Have used app for some years now and enjoyed using it.
E,Unfortunately keyboard loading has got slower recently and word predictions worse.
B,THE APP IS STILL LOSING LANGUAGE PACKS ON  EVERY REBOOT.
N,It is awsome.
N,But the split keyboard function made note taking on my tablet actually doable in class.
N,This is the absolute best solution to easily switch between language without ever noticing.
P,Fantastic.
P,"Fast and smart, awesome keyboard :)."
E,"I am enjoying this, it's easy to use, pretty keyboards to choose from, and seems to be very fast, I recommend."
P,Great app.
E,It's so easy to use & usually makes good suggestions for words.
P,I love it.
R,I wouldn't want to text without it!
N,It's slow with back to back texts but that's nothing compared to how great this works.
E,Prediction and auto correct almost 100%spot on.
E,"The app looks great visually,  but when I'm typing I notice little things like when a word is auto corrected, I'm unable to delete the word with one tap of the backspace key, and when I press any punctuation mark, a space is automatically put after it,  which is fine, but when I press space out of habit, it puts an other space, which makes whatever I'm typing look awkward."
E,"There are others,  but this review is already pretty long."
B,Fix these and I'll rate 5 stars.
B,Finally fixed the lag on my GS3 when launching the keyboard and typing.
N,Thanks!
N,Every time I try to send a text message with a face in it.
N,it says message might be corrupted and it turns into a question mark on text.
N,"Before the app was free, I bought it after my trial."
R,I believe in rewarding developers for creating great products.
N,SwiftKey was a superb product.
R,I'm not fond of the addition of emojis and wish that could be an option to disable them.
E,The keyboard gets stuck a lot.
N,"Once I'm done typing, after I close out of the messaging app (or anything that requires typing even) of choice... The keyboard stays up and blocks half my screen."
N,I've had to totally restart my phone a few times just to get it to go away.
N,Other times it makes me force close any other apps because of not being able to use half my screen.
N,It happens nearly every single time now.
N,(never used to do this).
N,5 stars otherwise.
N,Excelente reemplazo para el teclado stock de moto g.
B,I love this app but last SwiftKey was lite and easy to use but when i updated to latest version it slow down my phone while opening and mostly hang my mobile while typing.
N,When i restart my phone it automatically disabled.
B,Please fix this problem.
N,My android version 4.2.1.
E,After the last update it became slow as a turtle.
N,Nexus 5.
N,Android 4.4.4.

P,For a person going from a IPhone to a s5 and I love this app it's so easy to use.
P,Greatest keyboard ever!
N,Totally.
P,Best keyboard!!
R,Please make Chinese and Japanese too.
N,I'm tired of switching to other keyboards.
N,Don't know how I lived without it.
P,Best keyboard on the Android.
E,Terribly inaccurate; spend more time correcting wrong words than it would take to spell it out myself.
N,"Also, app doesn't know the word ""you"" Instead I get your, tory, tippy, type, root, upping, tipsy, toy, got, food, tour; etc.."
N,Some times when I'm using the Multitask option that the note 3 have (the 2 apps at the same time) when I tried to write some times the keyboard hide when I press any key and i only can write again when I only have that app alone open.
P,It's very excellent l love it so much.
B,"Clean,  looks good but lags out and crashes probably once a day."
N,Excelente aplicaci??n.
N,Have Mercy!
P,Good.
R,will there be a Chinese language pack in the future.
P,Very good App.
N,Works very well and a great alternative to swype .
N,Have been using it ever since the upgrade of Android and really think it performs better.
P,Great product.
N,Berfungsi seperti yang dikata.
N,Menarik dan fleksibel.
P,Great app love the themes.
P,It's been my favorite keyboard for years now.
P,Swift key is a great keyboard.
E,It does get annoying at times when it comes to the auto correct.
R,Would be much better if the swift key keyboard had a double tap space bar &gt;.
N,&lt; period option.
N,Is good.
E,It lags a lot more since it went free.
B,Please fix.
N,It's not just me.
N,Others I read are getting too.
N,I want stylish font.
N,Gonna try it n see what comes with 25mb package....
E,"Great, it predicts my thoughts."
N,Wow.
N,Such type.
E,Very correct.
P,Much good.
N,Really help.
N,Wow.

P,love it.
E,Bow down to the developer team for the excellent product it is almost necessary and addictive and super useful app for all Android devices and now available for free I can't believe that.
N,?????????????????
N,The best thing about this keyboard is that it automatically saves the key strokes which have been used by us irrespective of language used and when the word again needs to be entered this app recommends those keystrokes or words.
P,Great app to be in your possession...
P,I loved this keyboard and it's custom way of learning how you speak.
B,Until it updated and started correcting every other word i type when they did NOT need to be fixed.

N,It's completely unusable.
P,Great app.
P,The best keyboard app I gave used.

P,The best keyboard I have used so far on Android.

P,Otherwise its great.
N,Talk about productivity Apps!
N,This is the one to beat!
E,I use it for multiple languages in a consistently effective manner.
P,I urge you to purchase and use this honestly amazing App!
N,"What I dislike is freezing always,so guys try & do something about this menance."
N,add ascii art in the keyboard plzzzzzz its very good and by putting it you all will have a profit plzzz think about it.
P,I'm loving it.

P,Outstanding.
N,I got my number row back!

P,I love being swift......
E,It makes me that... Totally awesome and customizable.
P,Awesome I love the style and how the keyboard is arranged.
N,"really enjoyed the emojis but I spend more time correcting all the mistakes because I can't just type, it's ALWAYS trying to change everything."
N,"Also, the keyboard would just stop working randomly and I have to wait a few sec."
B,until it decides to work again or get out of the app and open again to be able to type.
E,Made my phone really slow too.
N,I gave it a shot and tried to like it but it just didn't work out for me.
E,"Although I love the emojis and didn't seem to drain my battery, I'm uninstalling."
N,"Much better than any standard keyboards, and it guesses much better more than I thought possible."
N,Some of the new emoji features feel a little forced.
P,It's the best one I've used so far.
E,Autocorrect is as accurate as apple keyboards!
R,"If I can recommend an improvement, I would suggest the writers to come up with Chinese input."
N,That's the only flaw in this app .
P,"Other than that, it's perfect!"
E,Very nice...  It works very smooth...
N,I was looking for a keyboard like this.
N,I'm so glad that I Got this app.

N,"And,  this was what I needed."
P,Perfect Looker.
P,Good response.
N,"Perfect predictions,  it knows me :P."
N,Nice emoji's.
N,Device: Asus Zenfone 5(Intel SoC) on 4.3 JB.
N,"My favorite keyboard, except for the fact I paid full price & then it ended up on sale for .99 so I feel like I should've got a credit or something."
N,"I don't like some of the changes that have been made since I first bought the app, when I had a different phone."
N,No matter how many times I change phones I always end up choosing SwiftKey over the one that comes with the phone.
P,Excellent.
P,Great help.
E,It is easy set of keys...??
N,Works well looks good.
N,I have seen this keyboard putting my device in to safe mode but eversince the update it has become relatively less.
P,Great.

E,Easy to get hooked too.
E,Nicely laid out and a snap to use.
P,great app.
N,"Sometimes it gets very slow on certain apps, like hangouts,  or Facebook messenger."
B,It seems to lag when it attempts to bring the keyboard up - it's not my phone; it's high end.
N,it's the application itself.
P,This is awesome app great in English and great in Persian.
N,Recommended.
N,"On my HTC One M8, it lags none."
N,And that's key.
E,On my GS2 and TF300T it lags like no tomorrow.
N,So get hardware that is good enough and your gold.
E,This keyboard is the honest best at predictions and learning how you type.
E,Plus it vibrates at lot with adjustment and I personally love that.
P,"Six starts, awesome job guys."
R,I need to be able to write in two languages and SwiftKey is the best at it.
