R,"Great for navigation, but Android version seems to lack the option to set multiple destinations (at least in India)."
N,"Definite 5 stars if this capability can be aded in Android, similar to the one on the Desktop version of Google Maps."
N,It works great.
E,"However, sometimes voice navigation has issue with 3 way forks (or two 2way forks placed right after each other), where it will say something wrong like ""use the right lane to keep left at the fork"" when it should be something like ""Use the right lane to keep right at the fork, then keep left"""

N,"It is working now, thank you."
P,Great app.
E,Very helpful.
E,Love the train schedules.
E,Surprisingly accurate!
N,Some issues.
N,"I like it all around but have issues with it not showing me an alternative route until I've passed it,  not showing me which lane to be in when it says to go straight and the lane I'm in turns off and it becomes one lane, and that it goes dark when the sun goes down and I can see the route or street names."

E,Prety good got better w/updates.
B,The bugs that I had complained about seem to have been fixed.
R,Would be fun to play with the voices but it has and will for the foreseeable remain my Go To GPS.
N,Recent updates changed turn-by-turn.
R,"Unless I'm missing a seting option somewhere, the last two updates made the navigation view change so that it is no longer a relative view from behind your car, but one from above that is locked to have north facing up."
E,This feature was hugely helpful when driving.
E,"I don't dislike the new view (it's nice for giving directions), but if want to know what  the upcoming turn looks like, I can't view it from my perspective, just from the map's."
B,Location fail.
N,Locate 0.5 km difrent place

N,Finally when you can and complete the route the new route  never shows in history just routes from years ago.
N,Last update glitch.
N,"Generally love this app as it would give me bus route times, but now it is telling me only go transit routes."
N,Even though there are buses around me it says no route found.
N,if it doesn't show me routes its pointless for me.
N,Second time this hapened after an update.
N,Even if I select bus it only shows go transit.
B,My location not working after you click the location circle.
N,Crapy 'downgrade'
E,Inaccurate and old directions which are incorect.
N,Follow these instructions if you want to be mislead or go where you don't want to go.
N,"Motorola X. Guys could you make one good think, when I'm going by public transport , the app sugest to me many different ways, for example if I choose one way I gonna get two or three numbers of busses , but some times bus could late , but on my map time table I see just time of buss which is already gone, to update the time I must go back and make search again , but sometimes  the adress that I have write before could pomp up, and It forced me write again the adress, could you make please buton ""update"" time next bus"

N,"Windows phones are better than google's android, you mast see how windows phones work and than see yours, Develop your android like windows"

N,Says I'm about two miles away when connected to wifi until gps gets a fix.
R,Location services needs a way to report inaccuracies.
N,What did you do?
N,I drive for a living to people's homes in different states in unfamiliar areas constantly.
N,I've used Google maps exclusivity until i recently updated.

N,"The street where I live is called santa maria and in the app it says san esteban wtf, terible ap"
B,Timing bug within app.
N,"Maps was working fine until I reset my phone due to google play not connecting; now whenever I try to map a route via transit, no mater WHAT time I put, it always shows me transit times for 4 AM!"
N,How can I fix this?
E,It gets slow sometimes
B,It freezes up sometimes.
N,Cant find where I am at.
B,Has me on the wrong street and going the wrong way and bug is not fixed  sends me 15 miles away to 1/4mile from where I want to be at

E,It is not compatible
N,Kelly.
P,Best Navigon Ap I've Used Yet.
N,For regular driving.
N,No Truck Rought Info.
N,"Just select the Mic and speak your destination, and or adress."
N,Or you can manually type it.
N,In heavy traffic.
N,I've noticed that navigation will sugest a specific lane of travel and tells you your minutes saved.
N,Also  an alternate route.
N,It tells you the advantage in time.
N,"If you want to take the alternate sugestion,  just touch the screen  box and your route ETA times and directions have changed instantly"
B,My GPS is sudenly taking me to weird places and freezing up.
P,Not good.
R,No street names.
N,"Ever since Google introduced this new ""material design"" update (basically since the app icon changed, and each subsequent update since then) Maps does not give me street names."
N,"Instead all I get is ""turn right"" ""head northwest"" etc."
N,I have scoured the Internet and cannot fix this issue.
N,I know it is only with the most recent updates because I can uninstall the updates and set it back to default setings at which point the street names work just fine.
E,Very annoying.

N,I have not been lost yet :)
N,It's Ok
P,Great app needs to do better.
N,With Google maps it's kind of like the smart kid you give a B grade when he does grade A work because you believe he can do better.
R,"Now that I'm spoiled I really NEED to be able to name and organize my saved places and have more accurate location and less force closes.TRAFFIC should also be more maneuverable,in big cities like nice you guys have millions of pl on at same time  should help right?U have the power so start using it better."
N,Think outside the box and you couldCONTROL traffic instead of reporting it!
N,Hisence.
E,Very fast with true locations
E,Updates not an improvement.
N,Or maybe product of HTC M8?
B,Crashes all the time if destination is local (under 5 miles).
E,Traffic feature lags horibly.
N,Another instance of Google fixing something  for the worst.
N,General observation.

N,"It does have its quirks and it took me forever to figure out how to favorite things, but it works surprisingly well."
P,The best!
E,Beter than the rest.
N,What the hell did you DO?!
N,The latest update to this app turned it from a useful app I used almost daily into a waste of memory.
N,I used it almost exclusively for finding routes on pub.
N,trans.
N,It used to offer several potential routes with the oportunity to review and select what worked best.
N,Now.
N,Start Navigation.
N,Here's your route.
N,The only one.
N,"No, you don't get to see it firsyt."
N,"NO, IT ISN'T ACTUALLY ROUTING YOU ON PUBLIC TRANSPOTATION!"

N,Still checking alts.
N,<3.
E,It is easy to use
P,Love it.
P,Love it
E,"Daily use, its fantastic!"
E,Upgrade idea - erand optimizer.
R,"Let me input a list of locations I need to visit during a shoping trip, and Maps outputs the order that produces the shortest travel time and destinations, particularly if there are multiple possible locations for a stop, like WalMart or Staples or Albertsons."
P,Good.
P,Liked it
B,Can't hear it.
B,I can't hear a thing.
E,I put it on max volume and it's like a wisper but all my other aps sound are loud and clear.
P,Used to be great.
N,I'm not sure what hapened here.
B,"The app used to run flawlessly, but now, it doesn't even say I'm moving or it will say I'm somewhere I'm not."
E,Useful Tool.
R,"Great ap, but offline navigation must be adressed."
E,"Saving maps is hiden and difficult to find, as is the save location."

N,Helps with our travel.
E,And love the traffic overlay
N,Batery eater.
E,Consumes too much batery even when i am not using it!
N,On average around 20%.
E,It's unacceptable!
P,Too Bad.
N,I think IOS has the most trusted tracking sys then Android.
N,It's totally too bad when you update the Aps without any changes inside.
R,Ad missing place feature is not available in Oman.
N,Crap on Note 3!
N,Way off on Nav!

N,Trevor.
N,"Always does what i want , no worys."
N,Nice to use.
P,Good map

P,Love this app.
N,Every since update it's really turning into a headache it doesn't turn when you turn it's very slow at rerouting and I have to keep taping the screen because it just stops working very horible app now and very dangerous if you are driving.
N,My advice to everyone is get a different app.
N,I used to love it now I hate it and only giving it one star because I have too
N,It used to be really good but I don't know what hapened.
E,"It always losses signal, thinks we are on the wrong street, and is just overall inaccurate."
N,Disapointed.
N,"It's never stay on the blue line, i have full bars but voice says GPS Signal lost."
E,"Worst part it's the default for my Car Mode, can't change to another navigation"
E,it was really good before.
N,"today i used the app and it kept saying gps conection lost, and it wouldn't give me the directions to where i wanted to go!"
R,i hope it goes back to how it used to be!
N,Never Lost.
E,Even the bus schedule it's accurate
E,Excellent for showing elevation ad nearby tertiary channels if you're prospecting.
P,Great !
P,Horible.
B,"Probably the worst app on my phone, after every turn it says GPS signal lost."

N,I can't trust it 100 percent in big cities or in tx especially around Dallas but I'm thankful to have it available anyway
N,ap has declared that it is 2am where I am and refuses to let me set transit directions to any other time
B,Bugy.
E,Location isn't accurate.

E,I don't get voice nor accurate info leading me to the corect location.
E,Too slow.
N,Used to be the best app on Android but  new updates make this nearly useless.
N,The program does not tell you soon enough when to turn.Slow to find your location.
P,Really bad!
N,I will get an iPhone next if Google can't make this a better experience.
N,Why can't i edit my reviews!
E,Increased accuracy on exact location awareness without the use of GPS
N,Google map!
P,Best compass app ever on android phones!

E,Bad navigation.
B,I strugle to use the navigation in my HTC one max it freezes when I'm geting close to my turns and it also freezes when it starts I have to zoom out to manage to get to my destination

N,Loged into my account on a PC you can save a route but it does not see the saved route on the app.
N,Suckss big time.
E,Navigation sucks the dam map will have you turning on  the wrong streets.
N,Why doesn't it tell you how fast your going?

N,Only as good as the signal.
E,With the luxury of strong and consistent 3/4g and WiFi signals it's a reliable navigational aid.
N,Stray into less fortunate waters and it's a different story.
N,Wander too far off the beaten track and it's definitely pot luck once the 3g is more miss than hit.
N,If you're likely to be travelling any significant distance this possibly isn't the navigational tool you should be relying on.
P,Excellent app.

B,New update Crashing - Lenovo S860

R,I believe that people with two eyes should be made more aware of it's existence.
R,"In adition, Mr Google, could you please make possible some kind of navigation while inside the Street View VR?"
R,The magnet on the Cardboard would be a start.
R,A game controller would be an improvement.
R,An app on Oculus Gear VR would be fantastic!

P,It's good
B,Bugy.
N,"Using Note 4, i don't know why it often force closes."
N,"Not all the time, but enough to be inconvenient."
N,Maybe it's  because of the recent update.
N,"I used to have no problem with Maps, used to be highly reliable."
E,"The satellite is always lost, gets me lost and to the wrong place like Siri on Aple did."
N,Great job on the update.
N,NOT
N,Update screwed it up.
N,"GPS on, WIFI on, fave me my search results that I want."
N,Then for some reason it directed me half way around the world.
N,Still can't beat the Garmin in 10 yes ago.
N,It's free so maybe that's why Google cannot offer more options like editing favorite places names or having list of favorite places like Home or work.

N,It's so frustrating!
N,Turn by turn.
E,The best for navigating or pinpointing your own location.
N,Only twice in 15 years has it navigated me wrong and that's probably more the fault of poorly updated information to the database.
P,"Great ap, a MUST HAVE!"
E,It is not accurate anymore.
N,It used to work flawlessly now it's not bringing me where I want anymore

R,Hope that gets resolved soon.
N,Like Orignal Version Beter!
E,I liked how I use to be able to very easily select my contacts and find which bus I could take.
N,They made it way to overly unnecessarily complicated!
E,I take the bus and quick selections are incredibly important.
N,Every second maters with buses.

N,Why did you take away the zoom controls?
N,What are you thinking?
N,"Now to zoom out it is tap, tap, drag, instead of just a single tap."
N,Talk about a downgrade.
E,Style over substance is what this app is all about.

N,This app never steered me wrong.
N,Unlike others.
R,I do wish it had some of the options like the app Waze.
N,"They alert you of accidents,traffic jams or even switch you to alternate routes."
B,Waze is a bit distracting sometimes but those things do help.
N,Something to consider Google.
N,Oh yeah one thing about Google maps I noticed is that you can't go to fast because the app or GPS doesn't have time to keep up if you have to make certain turns.
E,Other than that it's very simple to use.:)
