E,Best fake review app out there!
N,I downloaded this app when on vacation in a small resort town (where all the restaurants and nightclubs are on the same road.)
N,It became clear to me that there was something up with their reviews.
N,Restaurants with a lot of 1 star reviews were busier than some with 5 stars.
N,The nice 1 star restaurant we ate at didn't even have the item on the menu that one of the 1 star reviewers complained about.
N,Yelp is nothing more than the mob making businesses pay for the protection of their 5 star reviews.
P,Good to go.

R,Response please on how to corect this?
N,People who don't know how to review shouldn't.
N,This is not a place for your yelp business reviews pl.
N,This is a place to rate the yelp app.
N,Think before typing.
N,Other than the fact that thr majority of the yelp app ratings were penned by idiots thus making the true rating of this app unknown I found it easy to use.
P,One of the best aps I've used.
P,I love them all
N,What can I say but YES.
N,From the time that I've started using Yelp it has opened my eyes to the world of food around me.
N,"literally, I can go to any city I would like and find the best of food that is right for my palate without having to leave my car."
N,"All because of one aplication on my phone, thank you you Yelp."
N,"I would sugest this ap, this way of life to any friend I come across."
N,Events.
E,I love the event listings.
E,"I dislike the new, batery draining interface."
E,"Tedious, unthoughtful, aesthetically displeasing design to simply get up-to-date with Google's Material Design."
E,"I dislike having to keep opening the side menu to access what used to be on an apealling, quick, icon-based main page."
E,"If they had wanted to do something new and exciting, they should have developed an atractive and useful widget, not this failure."
N,Drains my batery like crazy when it's running.
E,Disapointed with the new update.
R,"Also, there is no way to turn off auto update."
P,Thee Best Ap EVER.

N,I highly recommend downloading this ap!

P,Great Ap
N,It works great.
N,No complaints from me
E,Really Confused.
N,I had heard a lot about Yelp so I decided to download the app and start leaving reviews of some of the places I had been recently.
N,And now they're all not visible on the business page.
N,What a waste of time.
N,I will be deleting the app.
N,The 2 stars is because if it weren't for my reviews being deleted I would actually like this app.

E,"Too many uninformed, pety and juvenile reviewers."
E,Ihelpful idea.
R,"There should be a gauge or indicator that shows if the vendors ever even check out their own ratings, how often and last time checked,  individual ratings read, etc.."
N,"This would show customers whether the vendor even cares or not and whether they make improvements or as many seem to,  ignore their customers."
N,Can't live with out it.

N,I can now go to new places with confidence!
N,"A new Hotel, restaurant, or even theme park this app has it all."
E,Awesome comunity of people.
E,YELP IS BAD FOR BUSINESS.
N,"While many of my business' reviews are 5 star, several are not and they are reviews that YELP does not even verify that the review is in fact from a customer of MINE."

N,I can't see a list of map pins after redrawing the search.
N,It's not even an option.
E,"Considering this is a mobile ap, I think the interface should be seamless and easy to use on the go."

N,I usually look at both pos and neg reviews.

R,"The first page should have easy access butons e.g. check in, search etc."
N,Good foog 100% mexican and vallarta
E,Hate the new design!
N,What were they thinking?
N,I primarily use yelp to find places on the go and it's ridiculously confusing with all the options in the new sidebar.
N,Was there any UI testing at all?
E,It is very helpfull.
N,Did a lot of research btwn reviews and locations to the perfect beuty salon.
N,thanks yelp
P,Great Ap.
E,It is very useful in geting the 'scoops' on local options while traveling.
N,I founds some great deals and places
N,I wish I could rate a 0.
N,The wait staff accuse someone that is wealthy enough to buy the arm pit of a bar of walking out on a 29.00 tab  really?
N,I watched him pay it and the waitress said it didn't hapen after he left.
N,That is an old game.
N,Don't go there it is an arm pit.
N,Unless you want to be called a liar and be disrespected by there hourly employees.
N,Much nicer places to go in Douglasville like  across the street or  joeys on Fairburn.
N,Don't waste your time.

B,The aplication freezes and crashes frequently.
E,It is very disapointed.
E,Great resource!
N,It's broken
N,NEEDS WORK.
E,STABLE and SMOOTH BUT LACKS POLISH.
N,"Showing businesses that are curently closed or about to close UNLESS you manually filter for ""open now"" EVERY TIME YOU SEARCH makes the results problematic."
N,Poor mix of results (searching for sushi should not include bars and piza joints).
E,"Distance finder range is not wide enough, i often need to just set the filter to search my entire city which requires going back and resubmiting the entire search - there is no filter to keep expanding the radius once the search is submited."
N,Former Customer.
N,One time I went there with 2 eyebrows and came out with 1 and a half.
P,Love Yelp!
N,Have been using yelp for years.
P,My favorite site to find restaurants!

N,A must have.
P,Perfect.
P,Great.but.
N,I have found many new restaurants that were great.however have also run into 2 places who have deals on this app who claim they did not place it and can't get it removed.this leaves a bad taste in my mouth and a fear to purchase any more deals.
P,The best resource of good food

P,Love it!

N,This is the first app I go to when looking for local places.
E,I love all the available information about its location.
N,Let's me know a lot about a place before I go.
N,Don't like being forced to download.
N,Tried to leave a review for a restaurant and yelp forces you to get their app.
N,I shouldn't be forced to download something that I don't need.
N,That's the whole point of the Internet.
P,Fantastic!
P,Great tool for eats.
N,hair stylist.
N,Colorist specialist
N,Much much much better.
P,Loove
E,It is very useful app.
N,Staff was kind.

N,Even tho I was on my first beer.
N,Didn't even finish it.
P,It's all good.
N,Girls are hot.
N,Isn't that what we go to hooter for anyway.
N,Waste of time!
N,Don't bother to install this app.
N,I was excited to get this app.
B,Unfortunately this app DOES NOT work properly.
N,Every time I input something on the search bar it asks if I'm a ninja and that nothing was found try again?!@?!? Wth!

E,It is very frustrating!

E,Awesome improvement to the app.
N,Much yelp.
E,It is very rate.
N,Wow
P,Best Ap.
N,I have found so many excellent places to eat and still searching
N,"What did you do, Yelp?"
E,Having the icons on the screen was helpful -- I could go right to what I wanted.
N,"Now I have to open the left side menu, scroll down to what I want to find, and hope the slider isn't still moving and makes me select the wrong thing."
N,So disapointed.

P,Love it
B,Great Ap but Crashes Often
N,A must have.
N,"If you don't want to fall victim to the ""i wish i knew before hand"" symptom, then you need this app."
N,Reviews by your average people who make it easier to get around and find the right and wrong places to experience
N,Like a treasure hunt.
N,I was dubious about this at first.
N,"I'll admit I didn't really see all the fuss, but my family has started using it more and more, to choose random places to try out or find things when not near home, and we've come time really enjoy our litle hunts!"
N,Owner.
N,This is by far the worst company I have ever dealt with.
E,Really useful app.
P,Great app for finding places.
E,"Food, Entertainment, services."
R,Just wish it was easier to get menus and prices for restaurants.
P,"Them this would be the all time best ""Finding Fun"" app."
P,Good.
N,Helps with what I need and givesme an idea of what I want.
N,"Dumb senseless, makes Sign in and out, pass word code, what an annoying, and"" useless thing."
N,Great Reference Ap!
N,It's the best app to determine if a place if good or reliable before you even go there.
E,"Extremely useful, not just restaurants but also for repair places, events etc!"
N,Can have enough of it!
N,Daily Necessity.
N,I use this app daily and am so thankful to each and every person who contribute reviews.
P,Love it!
N,I use yelp as a reference tool
N,Always what I want!
E,Bad service
P,Good app.
E,"It is easy to use interface and runs well, noo crashing, etc."
N,Recomended.
N,I use YELP to suport businesses in my community.
N,The YELP app is one of my favorite tools to showcase my buying experiences and suport local business.
N,Err:509
N,Yelp decides which reviews stay and which ones are deleted.
N,A friend opened an upscale Mexican restaurant and after the grand opening many were leaving favorable reviews which were deleted by yelp and for some reason kept negative comments that are not true.
N,Yelp decides which reviews stay and which ones they delete.
N,"This app does not reflect the consumers, therefore it's useless."
P,Great.
N,Good for geting to know a place before you visit
E,It is better than google maps.
N,For finding things close to you!
N,Use it often.
N,We use this app when we're on vacation or in unfamiliar local areas to find new and interesting places.
P,So far it's been good to us.
P,The best for years!
N,Been using yelp for years.
P,"I love it and when it comes to food, I live by it."
E,(5/16/2015: New interface is smooth and clean.)
N,Learning Curve.
E,"The most recent update changed the way you find and view things, and there isn't a home page, per se."
N,I still use it almost daily and enjoy competing against other locals to earn royalty points.
P,Great app.
N,I always use it to discover a new restaurant to try.
E,It is easy to use
P,Awesome.
E,nice community and all the reviews are on point with the place your looking for!

N,This is how I navigate NYC.
P,Love this app.
E,"UI downgrade, batery killer too."
N,Can no longer navigate app intuitively
R,I want the default filter to look for restaurants that opens now.
N,Can't
N,Completely drains my batery!
E,"The new update is beyond awful, drained my batery 70% in a few hours."
N,Off it goes!
N,"Great, but intrusive app for people wanting to save themselves from less than good experiences."
N,There's also many freebies from merchants trying to earn your business.
E,It is very handy app for travel.
E,We have been using yelp while on a hiking holiday in Sedona Arizona and found it very easy and useful.
N,Buyer beware.
N,Someone said they pay you 58 dollars to give them a good review.
N,I got fooled by the good reviews.
N,They are the worst company and bigest liers I have ever dealt with.
N,Run!
E,Great customer service and a large varieties of flavors !
P,Love it :)
N,Sucks big time.
N,Why are people leaving food and restaurant comments on here?
N,"I'd like to know others opinions on YELP, not their dining experience!"
P,Best chiropractic ever.
N,DR. SOREN HAS BEEN A LIFE SAVER I HAVE MANY BACK PROBLEMS AND MIGRAINE ISSUES AND OUT OF ANY CHIROPRACTIC I HAVE EVER BEEN TO HE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS EVER HELPED ME FEEL HUMAN AGAIN AND HE IS SO REASONABLE WITHOUT INSURANCE I HAVE TO PAY UP FRONT BUT HE DOES WELL WITH WORKING WITH ME.
N,THANKS FOR ALL YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY DR.SOREN
N,My go to app for almost everything!

P,Love it!
E,Yelp is prety cool.

N,It can also really help you avoid a potential disaster.
N,Use it food hunting.
P,Love to use this app for finding new restaurant.
P,Love it.
N,I've been going to this restaurant for years and the owners are the best.
E,The food and whole concept is awesome.
E,"Some reviews say they should update the decor, but the food quality and experience over shadows the decorations."
N,You could come to this restaurant once a year and you'll be treated like you were there yesterday.
R,"No menus, great price, awesome fresh food and great drinks."
N,You can eat as much as you like all for  one low price.
N,We always make this place a night out and they never disapoint.

N,Yelp Rocks!
E,Love user friendly functions and great look!
P,Amazing ap
E,Convenient.
E,This is the prety cool ap
P,Good app.
N,Good app to find new places to eat.
N,It's yelp.
E,It is very useful.
N,Make a list of countrirs where it works!
N,"Only after installing you get a messege ""not available in your country"""
E,Easy.
E,It is easy to use and easy to find businesses.
E,Yelp is a unreliable resource.
N,I have seen numerous reviews that are clearly from patrons bashing restaurants based on person opinion of individual employees.
N,I was under the impression that yelp could be looked to as a resource to find real reviews of restaurant experiences and not as a place to promote slander from disgruntled ex-employees or biter rival businesses.
E,Huge improvements!
N,Your app software.
N,Your software updates are DEFINITELY worth the time to download to my Galaxy S5.
R,"My small complaint, is to please post customer reviews for restaurants promptly, and accurately, for small places, as well as larger ones!"
R,It needs more work
P,It is very good
N,Yelps need to be shown in order.
N,"Good ap,  but they should show all of the reviews,  not the ones the like."
R,Yelps should be shown.
N,Yelp should post all yelps in order as posted.
N,Everyone should be able to yelp.
N,It is not just the ones that do it all the time.
E,Quality app.
N,It does exactly what you expect: makes reviewing restaurants much easier and looking them up a snap.
N,No major complaints really.
P,Love yelp.
E,It is very impressive
N,Please stop buging me to rate this ap
N,My opinion.
N,Everyone who is in the Fortworth area and need storage needs you should stop by storage choice on bryant Irvin road their prices were reasonable and the process was fairly quick.
P,Great.
E,Really helpful
N,Seafood!
N,Seafood is always fresh and the owner goes out of his way to make sure you are satisfied!
N,My go to place!
N,Build your own pool.
N,Custom pools
E,Outstanding design overhaul to an already essential app.
N,Keep it up
N,Trouble.
N,New software revision acting up.
P,Sad cause I love this app.
N,It works perfectly.
N,Do not understand what it could do more or why I would want it to.
P,Great.
N,Allows me to fully express my feelings about a business.
N,Yelp.
P,Great site.
N,WTF?
N,I used it daily until 3/6/15.
N,It always worked well.
B,Now the app crashes immediately when opened.
N,"I've uninstalled/reinstalled it five or six times, still no luck."
N,It's always worked on my Galaxy S3 until now!
N,"Ok here we are now 3/10, five days later and the app still crashes every time I open it."
N,I never had an issue with the app until the 3/6 update.
B,"Every time it crashes I send a report, come on people fix this, please!"
B,"Ok, today is 3/15/15, I installed the latest Yelp update, it still crashes!"
N,Sucks!
E,Prety reliable.
N,"I use every time I go out in the city, whether it's good eats, a nice smoke shop or 24hr services."
P,Love ping's.
R,"My family had been going to ping's since the 60's,  they used to be on bayard st, than they moved to mulbery st, they are  the only  one can made beef jerky taste so good, I travel from Brooklyn Just for their beef jerky, my 14 year older grandson love them too!"
N,Most in-depth app for reviews
P,Awesome!
N,But a tad bit glitchy.
N,It doesn't always work on my S4.
P,I love the app though.
N,Public storage.
E,Awesome storage faciluty!
N,Ask for raquel she is a great!
P,Love me some Yelp.
P,I love using yelp.
N,You can learn about places you've probably been passing by all your life or find something in locations you've never been before.
E,And the update is so far so great!
N,Why do I have to download the app to leave a review?
N,YOU SUCK!
N,"I really wanted to leave a positive review of a place, but aparently can't do it from my mobile without downloading your crapy, crapy, crapy app to do so."
N,Will delete the app as soon as I've left the review.
N,At least I get to leave a bad review to lower your rating.
E,"The best food ap, now with gorgeous Material Design."
P,"Yelp was already my favorite food app and website, and the implementation of a semi-Material Design makes it nearly perfect."
P,"Loving it, keep it up!"
N,Color clash.
E,"The green and red color scheme don't work so well, maybe just a St Patrick's Day thing."
N,Either way doesn't go well together.
E,Great update.
E,Love how you can see stuff now near you and than click on map and shows you exactly where all those places are and love the recommendation area.
N,Just an idea you guys have a option to look for places that deliver.
N,I think it be great to have option that shows you which ones offer online ordering.
N,It is not bad.
N,"I've noticed the ""not recommended reviews"" seem to be manipulated."
N,"Coincidence or not but they're usually negative comments about the service, product or establishment that are put in that category."
N,"It is not sure if it's Yelp or the business itself moving the favorable reviews/tips to the front and hiding the negative ones in the ""not recommended"" section."
P,Love it.
E,Ease of Google and awesome UI.
N,two problems.
N,need to have location on or typed in even when the place name is known (auto-completion).
N,cannot report duplicate entries.
N,?? that was 2011.
E,search without location services is still foo.
N,"enter a digit, as for a ZIP, drops back to alpha entry."
P,It's a great app.
N,It lets me know what's what.
N,Unethical practices.
N,"I came into the dealership yesterday,  and I already had a vehicle in mind."
N,"When we began to talk financing the vehicle,  they tried to get over on me - offering me a car note that would have me paying double the value of the car."
N,"When I informed them that I already had a lender, they refused to give me a bill of sales, stating "" we don't want to sell it to you, if you don't finance with us!"""
N,"""We get points and earn more money if you finance with us."""
N,"It needless to say, I walked out!"
P,I love it
P,Love this.
N,Use it all the time.
E,Great Idea.
B,"I love the idea behind Yelp, but I don't know why the app doesn't work on my home WiFi."
N,"I received an email telling me to uninstall the app and try again.nope, didn't work."
P,Great.
E,"Connected to what maters , and being helpful"
E,Always helpful.
P,Love this app.
N,Use it almost daily.
N,"Have found many good options for dining, entertainment and more!"
E,Fairy  accurate.
N,I'll never read a restaurant on my first timeout I've been to places where I had a bad experience the first time awesome experiments a second I don't get fed reviews and les a good bad service all the time or pet food
P,Love it!
E,It is easy to use and honest opinions that can't be bought!

N,But VERY BAD experience tonight.
N,Yelp app.
P,Love it!

E,Service improved  :)
P,Great app.

P,Awesome!
E,Really finding this helpful!
E,Really helpful!
N,Fun app.
E,It is easy to use.
N,You going to have it if you live in new York
N,"It is not A ""necessity""."
E,"With ""Google Now"" on our more recent phones, the act of searching for a place is only the mater of a voice command."
N,The Ability to make sure a review is seen by many however almost seemingly starts here.
E,"The site is useful, when it works."
N,Sometimes it will tell me that I am too far away to check in while I am in the actual location.
N,Glad you've upgraded so we can finalize reviews from our phones.
N,This is an upgrade from 2 stars.
N,"Since a tip and a review are not the same, allow us to either write longer tips or more than one."
N,"Drop the snarky pre-programmed comments RE length of tip, and rapidity of check-ins, since you allow some people to to many in the course of an hour."
E,Update sucks.
N,Fix and put back to normal or I erase and so don't a lot of yelp elite
E,It is very helpful app.
E,This app is one of the best and very informative.
E,This app is really helpful especially when it comes to restaurants.

N,They sold me a crapy car.
N,My first car experience and it was negative.
N,They sold me a used car with problems.
N,"The car was sold, as is."
N,That should have been my clue.
N,$9500.00 cash was spent on the car.
N,I have had to get another transmission for the car.
N,"I feel they knew this car had issues, when they sold it."
N,"Now, it has another issue and the mechanic can't even fix it."
N,"I will be lucky,  if I can get rid of it for half the price or trade it."
N,They screwed me.
E,Good Reference.
N,I always go to yelp before trying out a new place.
E,"Restaurants, nail salons, and late night pubs are all rated."
N,Disapointed.
E,The service is very bad.
R,No customer service .
E,staff very insulting msnner.
E,very bad management over there.

E,It is easy to use and oh so helpful!
P,The Best.
P,I rely on this all the time and it's one of the best aps for Android.
N,Fine.
N,Runs fine on a Nexus 5.
N,Les encanta a mis hijos
E,Annoying update.
N,The same update apears at least once a week.
N,"I update, but doesn't take it."
E,Awesome redesign
N,Yelp is Yelp.
E,"It's a great and useful ap, though of course you have to take all bad reviews with a huge grain of salt, since complainers are more likely to be reviewers."
E,"BTW - I love the poor people who write app reviews here thinking they are writing ""yelp reviews"" of businesses."
P,Awesome  app.
P,Great app.
N,"When in doubt, yelp!"
N,"Wont let me download,"
E,It's great that hours and site links are easily available through the app (even if they aren't perfectly up to date).
P,Love it.

E,"It's prety simple, put the zip in my profile and have the app remember it."
N,Done.
N,Great help for travel and trying new things.

N,It has helped me in my travel plans multiple times.
N,This is my first stop before staying or eating anywhere!
N,Terible.
B,It doesn't work on tablet.
N,"I was looking for a business to rate, great business, and I had to use my phone with the tiny leters."
N,FIX IT!
R,"Good and mostly stable, the way it should be."
N,"The team has come together to put together an awesome app while ading new functionality along the way, very useful in tough situations where you're looking for places for groups to go."
E,"Certainly works in a pinch, but pictures sometimes don't load and the app doesn't function very well in offline mode when one is underground or in areas of poor signal and compelled to write reviews."
N,What is the point of G / FB login.
N,If I then have to ad a passed to the ap?
N,This is preventing me from creating an account and therefore really can't use the app fully.
E,A really bad design decision.
E,User friendly but needs improvement.
E,hi I love the new updated version of the yelp Ap!
R,"However, I wanted to make a couple sugestions."
N,Is it possible to ad emojis and a name 'taging' functionality (similar to facebook/instagram) within the ap's yelp talk forum?
R,Also it would be wonderful if we could browse and create lists as well as save them as personal favorite (which could be further sorted and filtered).
R,"Lastly, it would be an excellent convenience to have more filters when searching bookmark (e. g. curently open, cuisine type and $)"
E,Awesone service!
N,I've been here once before and I've been craving it ever since.
N,I came here at around 11 and service was quite quick(no line).

N,I use it to look at pictures when looking at the menu when I'm trying new restaurants
E,Invaluable.
N,"Any complaints I might have about UI are completely overiden by the fact that I rely on this app regularly, especially while traveling."
E,"Honestly though, with the curent update the app falls more inline with ""normal"" Android conventions and has become easier to use."
N,Or will once I figure out where things moved.
P,I love Yelp.
N,No longer are we as a people blinded by misleading jingles and confusing ads.
N,"We can unite as one, learning from each others failures and successes in the world of consumerism."

N,Forget the other ones.
N,This one covers other places that the others don't.
P,"If you love eating and drinking this is the one, by far."
P,Love it.
N,Idea?
R,I wish it had a feature where businesses can follow specific employees and use their positive or negative reviews to depict future employment oportunities.
E,Great search engine.
N,I use  the Yelp app to check out restaurants that we want to try.
N,I get a good overall rating/opinion from other Yelpers.

E,The staff was very nice.
N,I am definitely going to back soon.
P,Love it.
N,What else could you ask for?
P,Great app.
N,Keep these reviews coming folks.
N,"I love how much I can prescreen before I go to shop eat or patronize these places, especially since we recently relocated!"
N,Can't even download it!
N,Keeps giving me error
E,Poor design and poor search.
N,why would you remove check in from the main screen and not make it obvious in nav?
E,Also search has been so bad.
N,I use the filter and don't get any results fiting in that filter.
E,Tacos are not Russian.
N,Neither is sushi.
N,I don't want this app.
N,"but, the website won't let me write a review without it."
N,I don't any more self starting aps that give me iritating alerts that I don't want.
N,"Thanks, yelp."
P,Fantastic.
N,I travel a lot and Yelp has never let me down.
N,Always helps me find a great place to eat.

N,And now I like to write reviews about my experiences.
P,Best app ever.
N,I always use it where ever I go.
N,"I love Yelp to help find new places, but don't like some get filtered with solid reviews while lots get left in and it is from a Husband and wife or family and the later have created an account just to say the same thing the other wrote."
R,"Also think it should be changed that in order to leave a review, you must check in."
P,Love it.
N,It is great when your out of town and not familiar with locations and can see feedback
P,Like using the Yelp Ap.but.
E,"New Update does not flow well, having more steps than needed."
B,And the freezing issues with browsing too many photos still hapens.
N,"I have been able to plan, find and schedule dependably for dates, dinners and even find coffee shops."
P,Love yelp.
P,good ap
N,Savers.
N,Thrift store.
E,Always helpful but.
N,Is there a way to view events *not* based on Curent Location?
N,History/Period of Reviews.
N,"I am close to falling in love with this ap, but there is one missing perk that has bothered me accountable times."
N,"Thus, the 3 stars rating stays until then."
N,Could you please fix the reviews to 'Most Recent' rather than all of them mashed together on the list?
N,I'm also wondering why many of the recent posted reviews aren't showing up till few days later?
P,Best location tool!
E,Excellent search engine for finding what you need!
P,(And knowing it's the best!)
P,I love Percision 6.
E,Renee is the BEST!

E,Central Cal Designs.
N,My ideal became a real dream thank you designing department for coping with me on all the changes.
N,The new foursquare!
N,This is just like foursquare used to be with check ins badges and elite status.
N,However elite status gets you better perks with yelp.
N,Now I can delete the mess that is foursquare / swarm and use an app more people are actively using
N,Use it!
E,Great detail s on places to eat:)
N,Selectivity.
N,When you can't leave an honest opinion due to admin removing comments.
N,"True and valid comments must remain untouched, but this app is controlled by merchants, so you will only get sugar coated positive comments."
N,What a joke
N,I order a combo with 2 tacos.
N,As it's done cooking he took a hand towel put the taco in the towel an squeezed The taco oil out that was just ew.
N,Then I ask them to remake it but leave that step out (got to be a better way to drain it ) they did remake it but when I got home it was not ok to eat one of the tacos had a HUGE piece of plastic like you seen it when you put it on the plate I then called asking for my money back they refused an wanted me to get more food DONT EAT HERE UNLESS you WANT TO GET FOOD POISONING!

N,but must say that some off the people who work there are rude and are not a people person .
N,had a couple of concerns about my washer machine and the guy that works at night gets all bend out if shape And basically wants to put me in my place.
N,I was totally shocked on his manner and must say that I have been coming here since it opened and never been treated so badly !
N,The owner Jay needs to make some changes.
N,but overall its OK.
N,Want to be heard good or bad.
N,I'm so easy going and can accept a lot but the Burger king on 212th and 76th in Edmonds Wa consistently closes at 9-9:30pm when they say they are open untill 10pm.
N,it is very frustrating i wish they would just say they close at 9 so i don't keep walking over there and.
N,It is not being able to eat
P,Good app.Many features.
E,"I like monocle, it can be very handy."
E,Some local things are missing

N,"I liked it a lot, then I found out that all of the 90-plus reviews I'd writen are now filtered."
N,"I don't know the reason why, but I see no point in writing any further reviews."
P,Good app.
N,Just am hoping they have an update where you can save places you like in folders that are customizable.
N,I'm always looking for the places I've tried that i want to recommend in categories like sushi or bq.
N,Going through my bookmarks or my check ins isn't efficient
N,Well.
N,"What can I say,  I'm not hapy that you took the check in buton off the home page."
N,I'm  not a fan of the new lay out.

N,Thornton Dental.
N,They are terible dentist who treat you by the medical insurance.
N,If you have job insurance they treat like Royalty if you are a Medical recipient they put your needs on hold.
N,They lied to me and told me they were doing one root canal and they performed two.
N,One is incomplete for over two months.
N,They claim they don't have the tools to finish it.
N,They gave me a number to a dentist who doesn't take medical at all.
N,"It's been sixty days , I have a hole in my tooth its still not finished and they haven't helped"

P,Good work!

E,This app is a great way to find a place to eat whether you are on your lunch break or out traveling.

E,The  desktop  version   is ok.
N,You  can go around  and  around  trying  to get  the  corect  location.
E,Earlier versions were  ok.
P,Too bad.
E,Helpful.
N,You can always count on yelp for good sugestions!
N,Don't like the fact that you have to enter location every time open ap
N,Homie knows his Ink.

B,Crashes.
B,"Nice ap, if only it didn't crash every single day, not load any pictures, and freeze my phone for a few minutes."
N,TERRIBLE.
N,I only aded it so the website would stop asking me to download it and it wouldn't let me sign up because it wouldn't let me input my zipcode SO it was useless
N,Bullying bunch of bastardos.
N,Welcome to pay for your ratings app.
N,Gives business lower ratings for not subscribing.

N,If you need honest reviews.

N,lifesaver.
N,This app is prety much the most important app on my phone.
N,I'm new to my area and I don't know where anything is.
N,"Anytime I need food delivered, or I want to go out, I immediately pull up this app and search."
N,You put in what you are specifically looking for and it tells you where to find it and directions if you need.
P,It's perfect.
E,It is very frustrated!
B,The app freezes and it freezes my S4.
N,So annoying and it takes about 2 minutes to recover.
N,Have been using the website all week.
B,Please fix!

N,Yelp It Baby!
N,"When in doubt ""YELP IT BABY!"""
N,Marketing Arm has TAKEN over.
E,"New update is less user friendly, the GUI interface is all screwed up!"
E,The place you are checking into and are inside is now 3 pages after the places that pay to advertise.
E,They now have software that censors the useful and practical reviews.
N,I guess it is their way of controlling speech on their site/ap
P,Love this ap!
N,"It works just great, thanks to all the guys behind this."
N,Twanda.
N,I went to this place on March 6.

N,The silent advisor.
N,"It works great in busy metropolitan city, where young generation is actually using the app to give reviews, photos, inside scoop, tips etc.not so great in rural cities!"
N,All the filter features makes it easy to find exactly what you are looking for.and you can bookmark a place and save it to go later!
P,Good for discovery.
E,It is very easy to discover places both nearby and for a specific location.
R,It needs better way to save places instead of fidling with bookmarks.
R,Overall good but could get a litle unbiased
N,Great app to find local businesses and in particular restaurants.
E,"If you are a business, focus on offering a great product or service and the organic reviews will follow."

E,The photos don't always load but I accept nothing is perfect.
E,"It's obnoxious, but useful."
